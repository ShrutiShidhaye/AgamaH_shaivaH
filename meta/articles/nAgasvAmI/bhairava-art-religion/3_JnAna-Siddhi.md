_Jñānasiddhi_, a text included in this volume is a rare work which may be called a lost āgama retrieved. Veḷḷi-ambala-vāṇar Śvamikaḷ has done a yeomen service by extensive citation from this text. From various references to this text in the commentary it is seen that it contained several chapters that have not been cited and what we have is only a part. According to Veḷḷi-ambala-vāṇar the _Jñānasiddhi_ is an Āgama, counted among 224 secondary Āgamas, the 28 sub Āgamas and the nine main Āgamas. It is listed along with the following Āgamas.

1\. Jñāna sāram 2. Nirvāņa sāram 3. Tattva dīpam 4. Tattva Siddhi 5. Tattva sāram 6. Candra dīpam 7. Yõga siddhi

The text in its original format followed other well known Āgamic texts in its structure. At one place it is seen addressing the goddess Haimavatīśvari (p. 84). It is considered a text dealing with Vāma Dakṣiṇa Śaiva branch dealing with the benign school of Bhairava mata. The names of the following chapters have survived as they are mentioned in the citations. 1. Tantrāvatāra Paṭalam[^1], 2. Jñānāvatāra Paṭalam[^2], 3. Mūrtyamśa Paṭalam[^3], 4. Śaiva Prakaraṇa[^4], 5. Tatvāmnāya prakaraṇa, 6. Prāsāda prakaraṇa[^6], 7. Bhinnā-bhinna-vivekam[^7]

The nine main āgamas on which this Vama Śakta text is based are mentioned.

1\. Kulārṇava, 2. Kulottīrna, 3. Kula Sambhava, 4. Kulāmṛta, 5. Parānuttara āgama, 6. Kaulikam, 7. Kula śāsanam, 8. Siddhāmṛta, 9. Āmnāya Siddhi

The nine (mūla) main āgamas are:-

1\. Paratatva rāgam, 2. Śivāgamam, 3. Kālāgamam, 4. Paratantrāvatāram, 5. Śivasādhākhya prāsādam, 6. Paramāgamam, 7. Śaktyāgamam, 8. Dēva prāsādam, 9. Śivājñā sāram

Though this text is mainly cited while dealing with Dakṣiṇa Śaiva (Bhairava), school it is considered a San-mārga school (P.65) almost akin to the great text in Tamil, Thirumantiram, and is mentioned as _Suddha Śaiva_ system. It is also designated as _Vēdānta Siddhānta_, that it emphasizes.

The _Jñāna Siddhi_ considers eight schools namely 1. Nyāya 2. Vaiśeṣika, 3. Buddha, 4. Ārhatas, 5. Lokāyatas, 6. Sāmkhyas, 7. Mimāmsā and 8. Vaiṣṇavas as external schools, while the following eight are grouped as internal schools. 1. Śaivam, 2. Śiva Sammeḷanam, 3. Mahāviratam, 4. Bhairavaim, 5. Śivādvaitam, 6. Pāśupatam 7. Kālāmukham 8. Vāmabhēda

This Śaiva system is also divided in a different way into fourteen branches as

1\. Ūrdhva Šaivam, 2. Anādi Śaivam, 3. Bhēda Śaivam, 4. Guņa Šaivam, 5. Ājñā Śaivam, 6. Avāntara Śaivam, 7, Jñāna Śaivam, 8. Siddhānta Śaivam (Suddha-Śaivam), 9. Mahā Śaivam 10. Ādi Śaivam 11. Abheda Śaivam 12. Aṇu Śaivam 13. Kriyā Śaivam 14. Yoga Śaivam 15. Śiva Śaivam

To this list is added Tattva Śaiva and thus totaling 16 in numbers, under _Dīkṣā-vivēka_. The _Pañcākṣara Praṇava-vivēka_ states the three entities. Pati, Paśu, and Pāśa are common categories for all the Śaivas. Similarly the sacred ash (_Vibhūti_) and five _malas_ are in all Śaivam. Among all the divisions Suddha Śaiva is considered the most important.

1\. _Ūrdhva Śaivas_ wear all their hairs into matted locks, smear their body with ashes, wear _rudrākṣa_, perform daily rites, and perform worship of Śiva. These are the Śaiva signs of Urdhva Śaivas, who emphasize _mantras_.

2\. _Anādi Śaivas_ practice _mantra_ and _yoga_ (_mantra yogapara_) emphasize right conduct and the meaning of _Varṇa_ and _padas_, syllables and meanings; wear their hair into eleven matted locks; wear sacred ash and _rudrākṣa_, spend their time in Saiva acts by attending on the guru (_susrūṣa_) study Śaiva śāstras and be established in Śiva yoga, always move around practicing the three principles devoid of fetters, keep looking at Śiva images and practice penance daily and follow virtuous conduct. They are called Anādi Śaivas also called by an interesting epithat _sthanūpati yogya akṣārtha nirūpakāḥ_ that means fix their mind on Sthanupti-Śiva, and prove the meaning of Akṣa, the eye-denoting that he was looking at an image of Śiva for meditation as a part of his daily penance. This would indicate that Anādi Śaiva is not a practitioner and not Śiva himself. The _Kamikagama_ seems to hold Anādi Śaiva denotes Śiva himself.

3\. _Ādi Śaiva_ is an ācārya, who establishes the independent authority of the Āgamas, is a Tāntrika, Māntrika, and Yāntrika; is of good qualities, wears his hair into 12 _jaṭas_; wears sacred ashes and _rudrākṣa_, performs image worship (_Kriyā_), inquiries into the nature of truth; performs everything as enjoined in _Sivajñāna Śaiva Siddhānta_, and is desirous of attaining liberation.

4\. _Aṇu Śaivas_ wear their hair into twelve _jaṭas_, wear _rudrākṣa_ and _vibhūti_, devoted to the practioners of _caryā_, _kriyā_, _yoga_ and _jñāna_. They emphasize devotion towards practioners.

5\. _Avāntara Śaivas_, emphasize _Kriyā yōga_ and _Jñāna yōga_, wear nine _Jaṭas_, ash and _rudrākṣa_, hold Śiva as the doer of all acts, and attain the nature of Śiva at liberation.

6\. _Miśra Śaivas_ pay equal attention to _Kriyā_ and _Pūjā_ with their mind established in Śiva. They surrender all actions as a process of conduct.

7\. _Bheda Śaivas_, hold that everything is the manifestation of Śiva and Śakti, wears seven Jaṭas, ashes, and _rudrākṣa_ under all conditions. They believe that liberation is attained by reaching the abode of the lord.

8\. _Guṇa Śaivas_ wear a crest jewel (_śikhāmaṇi_) on his Jaṭas and hold that Trimūrtis emanate as a result of three guṇas. There is an emphasis on the three guṇas in this school. 9. The _Ajñā Śaivas_ emphasize the five sacred acts of Śiva (_Pañca-krityas_). They wear either three or five _Jaṭas_ and prefer either _Pūjā_ (_Kriyā_) or _Yoga_, hold devotion (_bhakti_), knowledge (_jñāna_) and determination (_vairāgya_) as important for performing _kriyā_ and daily observance that leads to liberation. They consider that one should obey the order of Śiva, follow _Caryā_, _Kriyā_, _Yoga_ and _Jñāna_ through which they attain the abode of Śiva, _pada-mukti_.

10\. _Yoga Śaivas_ wear five _jaṭas_, follow the eight fold observances of Yoga (_aṣṭaṅga yoga_), wears _rudrākṣa_, and _bhaśma_, perform daily rites, follow also _Suddha Satya_ that results in non-violance (_ahimsā_) and at the end achieves Śiva's form (_Sārūpya-mukti_) in every respect.

11\. _Jñāna Śaivas_ wear fourteen _jaṭas_, worship liṅga (_Lingārccana_), wear _rudrākṣa_, smear their body with ashes, eradicate five fetters (_pañca malas_) and reach a stage of feelingless state and enter into samādhi with a view to attain liberation. They steady their mind, renounce the world (_Sanyāsa_) shave their head, and remain devoid of the three _triṣṇās_.

12\. _Adhva Śaivas_ wear their hair into four _jaṭas_, Worship liṅgas, Wear _rudrākṣa_ and ashes, circumambulate temples, _prāsādas_, prostrate before the deities, perform daily rites, and hold reaching the abode of Śiva as the ultimate liberation.

13\. _Samanya Śaivas_ believe in _mantras_ as prescribed in scriptures and believe that Paśupati and other manifestations are taught by Śiva. They may retain their hairs, wear _jaṭas_, or shave off their hairs, follow the four fold path of _Caryā_, _Kriyā_, _Yoga_ and _Jñāna_, smear their body with ashes and wear _rudrākṣa_.

14\. _Śuddha Śaivas_ may wear _jaṭas_ or retain their hairs, perform _Śiva pūjā_, wear _rudrākṣa_ and ashes, get initiated into knowledge _Jñāna-dīksha_, hold five 'gu' (_pañca guhas_?) and cultivate compassion and practice the four fold path _caryā_, _kriyā_, _yoga_ and _jñāna_. The five mudras (signs) of Śuddha Śaivas are 1. _rudrākṣa_, 2\. Sacred thread, 3. Tuft of hairs, 4. Upper garment, and 5. Sacred ashes considered the Śaiva Veṣa. It is not clear from the available text whether these verses giving the _Mudrās_ (signs) and observances of the fourteen divisions are part of the _Jñāna Siddhi_ text or another text. Two other texts mentioned, giving the list of Śaiva divisions, are _Dīkṣā Viveka_ and _Pañcākṣara-praṇava-viveka_. The first _Dīkṣā Viveka_ gives sixteen divisions (_ṣoḍasa_) among the Śaivites, while the later _Pañcākṣara-praṇava-viveka_, lists 12 divisions. The details of fourteen divisions mentioned are not from these two texts. It is also not clear whether these two texts form parts of _Jñāna Siddhi_ or different texts. As mentioned earlier, several chapters of the _Jñāna Siddhi_ are mentioned in the commentary of Veḷḷi-ambala-Vāṇar, but these are not specifically said to be part of in _Jñāna Siddhi_. However I have included these here so that further research on _Jñāna Siddhi_ might clear the doubt.

The _Jñāna Siddhi_ as mentioned says that the Śaivas are classified into fourteen divisions (_śaiva bhedam caturdaśa_) and later adds _Śuddha Śaivam_ which would make the total fifteen. We may have to assume that the fourteen Śaiva divisions mentioned are external to _Śuddha Śaiva_ tradition, known as "internal-external" (_ābhyantara-bāhyas_) Out of the fourteen mentioned as Śaivas, details about the signs and observances of the Mahā Śaivas are not given in the text. Either the original _Jñāna Siddhi_ did not include the details or Veḷḷ-ambala-vāṇars, the commentator did not give that portion here.

According to _Jñāna Siddhi_ the _Śuddha Śaiva_ effects a unity between Vedānta and Siddhānta (_Vedānta-Siddhānta Samarasa_). It holds that the three Vedas, _Ṛk_, _Yajus_, and _Sāma_ are meant for rituals - (_Karma-Kāṇḍa_) and are the form of the Vedas. The end of the Vedas namely Vedānta expound the Supreme nature of _Para-Brahman_ and _Jīva_ (_antaram para jīvātmayoḥ aikyam parātparam_) In order to obtain that tradition (_sampradāya_) are expounded the ten states (_daśa-avasthā_). The respective path are prescribed for attaining the respective good path (_tattad-sanmarga-siddhyartham_). The Vedānta teaches those Supreme knowledge (_Mahāvidyā_) for the respective systems. The unity of Vedānta and Śaiva Siddhānta are superior to the (common) Śaivam. _Śuddha Śaivam_ should be understood as _Śuddha-san-mārga_. vedāntam śaiva siddhāntam dvayor aikyam śivātparam śuddha śaivam śivasamvedуаm śuddha śanmārga rūpakam

It should be understood that _Vedānta Śaiva Siddhānta_ is identical With _Śuddha San-mārgam_. The _Jñāna-Siddhi_ goes on to enumerate the tattvas, the process of creation, the Yoga system, and the ultimate liberation. The summary of the whole system is not attempted here but some salient points alone are touched.

The _Parā_ (_Paṟai_ in Tamil) emanated from _parātpara_ which is also called "_cit_". _Parāśakti_ emanates from _Paṟai_. The three Śaktis (_Icca_, _Jñāna_, _Kriyā_), will, knowledge and action emanate from _para-Sakti_. Between (after), _Icca_, _Jñāna_ and _Kriyā_ emanante; _Śivaśakti_ and _Sadaśiva_, from _Sadaśiva_ the six _tattvas_ like _nāda_ and _bindu_ emanate; from Sadaśiva emanates Maheśa, from him emanates Rudra, and from Rudra comes Viṣṇu, from whom emanates Brahmā. This is considered the order of creation. The reverse order is Brahmā, Viṣṇu Rudra, Maheśa, Sadaśiva, Bindu, Nāda, Parā Śakti and Para Śiva, constituting nine principles. The four principles above Sadaśiva (namely Parabindu, Paranāda, Parāśakti and Para Śiva) are generally taken together with Sadaśiva and hence the five principles are called generally Pañcamūrtis in Śuddha Śaiva.

The text also enumerates 96 principles, which are common to both Vēdānta and Siddhānta. The knowledge of these 96 _Tattvas_ is necessary for attaining _svarūpa jñāna_. The text also deals with the three basic _tattvas_ \- _Prakṛti Tattva_, _Vidyā Tattva_ and _Śiva Tattva_.

Veḷḷi-ambala-vāṇar cites _Svacchanda_ text which seems to be the _Svacchanda tantra_ that has come down to us as for example that the _Gangāvatāra paṭala_ cited is found in _Śiva Tantra, tenth paṭala_.[^9] Similarly the verses cited mentioning the origin of _Svacchanda tantra_ cited by Veḷḷi-ambala-vāṇar is verbatim in the _Svacchanda tantra_ that has survived. The _Svacchanda tantra_ gives the _dhyāna_ slokas of Tatpuruṣa, Aghora, Sadyojāta, Vāmadeva, and Īśāna, their meditation and the fruits derived from their worship.

kumkumābham ca nārēśam trinētram ca jaṭādharam pūrvānanam abhidhyāyet vāyubhakṣasya yat phalam[^10]

Tatpuruṣa, called Nārēśa. faces east, is saffron in colour, three eyed and wears matted locks of hair. The devotee meditating on him, obtains immediate results. The fruits of his worship may equal several thousand Aśvamedha yāga. Kṣemarāja defines the term Nareśa as _narāṇām īśvara - nareśa_. He is Tatpuruṣa Bhaṭṭāraka. If there was a variant reading mentioning Ardhanārīśa in the place of Nareśa, Kshemarāja holds that reading is not appropriate. He points out that Devī is said to be seated on the lap of the lord and the identification, as Ardhanāri does not arise. The meditator on Nareśa obtains siddhis within six months.

The southern face, Aghora called Bahurūpa is blue black in colour, wears reddish beard and moustache, terrifying face with uplifted brows, wears snakes and Kāpāla as ornaments with hairs matted. He is meditated for the removal pain and and pleasure and removal fever-Jvara and poisons etc. The one who meditates, shines like a glowing fire. He attains siddhis and liberation simultaneously.

The western face Sadyojāta is white in colour, with three eyes, and holds _akṣamāla_, and _kamaṇḍalu_. He bestows divine siddhis, removes all sins and bestows siddhis like Animā, Mahimā etc and at the end becomes Śiva. His meditation is resorted to for expiation of sins _prāyascitta_.

The northern manifestation of Vāmadeva face is like a reddish lilly (_raktautpala_) and is endowed with three eyes. The meditator, _dhyāni_ will attain the power to attract the world. He attains the power of attraction in one year.

The fifth face on top, is white, holds _trisūla_ and wears _jaṭādhara_, Snake as _upavīta_ skin, and holds _akṣamālā_ and _kamaṇḍalu_, _vīṇā_ and _damaru_, and liṅga on head. Kṣemarāja says the head will be in the form of a liṅga (_maulistham liṅgākāram_). Maheśvara may mean _eaka-vaktra_. It is the devotee who will attain all knowledge _śarvajñāna_ and attractive form in this life. The _Sarva-siddhānta-viveka_ provides a slightly different account of worshipping the five faced Sadaśiva, under Garuda and other Śaivas. It holds that the four faces are worshipped by those who aspire for worldly achievements for whom the four Śāstras, Gāruḍa, Dakṣiṇa, Vāma, and Bhūta Tantra Śāstras were taught by Tatpuruṣa and other faces and as such these are called _Adhas-Śrotas_ downward stream. The Tatpuruṣa, Aghora, Sadyojāta Vāmadeva are Vijñāna Kevalas. These texts are not independent authority but dependent on texts like Kāmikāgama.

Among them Gāruḍa relates to the worship of Tatpuruṣa. The worship of this deity bestows Siddhis immediately. The _Svacchanda_ does not mention Gāruḍa Śāstra but agrees with the result of worship, that would be conferred namely attainment of Siddhis.

The South face is mentioned in _Sarva-siddhānta-viveka_ as Ghora rūpa, and Para Brahman, would bestow cure from diseases, that are attained through mantra and medicines. This also is in agreement with _Svacchanda trantra_ which however does not mention the text Dakshina Tantra. The _Sarva-siddhānta-viveka_ states that the Vāma face should be worshipped with Vāma Śāstra for achieving all longings and prosperity.

The text _Jñāna-siddhi_ was probably available in full in the 17th cent for Veḷḷiambala-vāṇar, who has cited extensively from the same. It is mostly in poetic form but in two or three instances, prose portions are also found. Veḷḷi-ambala-Vāṇar citations are interspersed with quotation from other works, both in Tamil and Sanskrit, the continuity is interrupted and in some instances only a part of the cited verse is available making it different to give continuous numbers. For facility of reference the number is given partially for such verses. In most cases Veḷḷi-ambala-vāṇar gives specific reference to the text from which he cites. When the citation is from the same text, he also mentions "in the above text" that helps in reconstructing the text. In one or two instances however doubt arises whether the citation is from _Jñāna-siddhi_ or other text. Such instances are included in the text. The editors have done commendable job of transcribing the manuscript from palm leaf manuscript. Sri. Rajagopala Sastri the editor of Sanskrit text has done great service in the Sanskrit portion and explains in the introduction the difficulties encountered in transcription. However there are a few misprints as well. I have corrected such passages. In some portions some parts that were missing have been reconstructed from the later portions, where definitions are provided.

As the portions cited relate mostly to Dakṣiṇa Bhairava school, _Jñāna-siddhi_ is found mostly in the Pūrva Pakṣa part. It is possible that the text in full may still be available in some library especially in Banaras region and when found would throw flood of light on the Saumya school of Bhairava worship. It also cites verbatim or summarises in many places other texts like Upanishads, Vēdānta or Purāṇas.
