OṀ Uccāra


Recite A-U-Ṁ for as long as you can, placing the “A” around the navel area, the “U” around the chest area, and the “Ṁ” from the palate, up through the center of the eyebrows, all the way up to the crown of the head and above. Feel the spontaneous mūlabandha pressure and listen to the subtle resonance of the sound as it travels up.
