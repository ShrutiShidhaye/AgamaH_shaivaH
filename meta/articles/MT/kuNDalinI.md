In the oldest layer of the pashcimAMnAya the manifestation of the goddess rudrashakti or the ascent of kuNDalinI was quite impetuous. It is noted as triggering trembling, shaking, falling into a lucid dream sleep, visions of netherworlds, prancing on one limb, xenoglossy, jumping like an antelope, roaring like a lion and crying with tears. The yoga of the later layers (e.g., saundaryalaharI) and the dakShiNAMnAya succeeded in considerably taming the process and the Avesha elements considerably reduced or entirely vanished.
