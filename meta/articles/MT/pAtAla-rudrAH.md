There are multiple pAtAla-rudra-s but hATakesha is the ultimate one of them.In shaiva mantramArga, the rudra presiding over the 7th netherworld sauvarNa is hATakeshvara. His place is said to be inhabited by gaNa-s, rudra-s & their consort, the bhaginI-s (the goddesses of the vAma srotas), mAtR^i-s. Peculiarly the svachChanda account distinguishes the yoginI-s from the yogakanyA-s. 

kShemarAja tries to interpret them as human yoginI-s who have acquired siddhi-s through sAdhana and directly at birth, respectively. 

Notably, it is also equipped with rasAyana-s foreshadowing the rasa-bhairava tradition


## Gold connection
In old shaiva tradition one of the siddhi-s of mantra-siddhi was the capacity to discover subterranean treasures or mines।

> समिध्यमान ओजसा पिबति तन्निष्ठ्यूतं हाटकाख्यं सुवर्णं भूषणेनासुरेन्द्रावरोधेषु पुरुषा: सह पुरुषीभिर्धारयन्ति

This is the vaiShNava bhAgavata: however, it does preserve an ancient shaiva tradition of the connection of gold and rudra (as in the origin narrative of skanda in the rAmAyaNa). Elsewhere in shaiva tradition hATakI is mentioned as a goddess.


## nishvAsa levels
- In the fragmentary nishvAsa text of saiddhAntika tradition the mAtR^i-s  are said to inhabit the nethermost pAtAla. 
- In the next pAtala are the bhaginI-s of the vAma-srotas. 
- p3 are the pi~NgalamAtR^i-s wearing nIlotpala garlands. 
- In p4 are the kapAlamAtR^i-s of nIlalohita rudra. This rudra had slain the buffalo demon hAlAhala given his flesh to these kapAlamAtR^i-s. They were worshipped at the cemetery of kurukShetra along with nIlalohita. 
- In p5 are the kapAlarudra-s evidently the retinue of kapAlIsha-bhairava of the brahmayAmala. 
- In p6 are the yoginI-s & 
- in p7 are the yogakanyA-s. 

## AnandAdhikAra
In the vaiShNava-aligned shaiva tradition of the now lost AnandAdhikAra-tantra taught the homology of hATakeshvara with nR^isiMha who is similarly said to reside in pAtAla with a bevy of mAtR^ikA-s who manifest from his mantra.+++(5)+++
