This +++(=gaNapaty-atharvashIrSham)+++ and a related text the varadopaniShat are late texts. How late is hard to pinpoint. As I've pointed out before, the singular vinAyaka is a late-coalescing deity. This upaniShat & varada describe the mUlamantra (gaM) & the famed gaNapati-rakShohA mantra. 

The Sino-Nipponic transmission of these mantra-s suggests that they were popular by 860 CE. However, we don't find evidence for gANapatya tradition at the beginning of the common era.  So that gives you an approximate timeline for the emergence of these traditions related to these mantra-s. The South Indian V1s have secondarily added vedic accents to it in the late medieval period.
