## Intro
The Tripura Rahasya is a dialogue between Lord Dattatreya and Parasurama. It is also called the Haritāyana Samhitā after its author Haritāyana, son of Harita.

It is said to consist of 12,000 slokas in three sections - the Jñāna Khaṇḍa (Section on Supreme Wisdom), the Mahātamya Khaṇḍa (Section on the Greatness of Sri Devi), and the Caryā Khaṇḍa (Section on Conduct). Of these the first consists of 6,687 slokas; the second of 2,163 slokas; and the third is untraceable.
