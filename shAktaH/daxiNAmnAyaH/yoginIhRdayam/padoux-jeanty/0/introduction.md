In spite of its modest size, the *Yoginī hṛdaya* \(abbreviated as YH hereafter\), whose title may be translated as “The Heart of the Yoginī ,” rates among the principal works of Tantric Hinduism. For the lay reader who is not a scholar, this text may be surprising or disconcerting because of its language, its obscurities, and its challenging concepts. We have made every effort in our com-ments and annotations to clarify these difficulties in the text and have used extensively the commentary by Amṛtānanda called the *Dīpikā* \(“The Lamp”\). 

## Tantra tradition
Some help to the reader would first consist in placing the YH in its context, which is Tantric Hinduism, the world of Hindu Tantra. This, naturally, cannot be done satisfactorily within the limits of this introduction. A few points, however, may be made to situate the YH in the historical development of Indian Hindu culture and, in that culture, within the Tantric phenomenon. [^1] 

[^1]: There is also a very important, and still very active, Buddhist Tantric domain, sharing many traits with Hindu Tantra but very different in practice and notions.

This particular aspect of Hinduism, as far as we can say, seems to have appeared around the fifth century of our era \(we do not know exactly where\), as cults arose of mostly feminine, often fearsome deities whose worship included having the officiants become “possessed” by the deity, occasional sexual rites, and having the adepts follow particular observances \( *vrata* \). In contrast with mainstream orthodox Hinduism, the religious doctrines of these groups were not traced back to the Veda by their followers but attributed to deities, a male god, most often an aspect of Śiva/Bhairava or of Viṣṇu, or a goddess, usually Kālī . The religious beliefs of these ascetic groups were deemed to have been revealed by these deities. The texts upholding them are usually called Tantra but also Āgama \(tradition\) or Saṁhitā \(collection\). They were composed in Sanskrit by brahmins, which demonstrates that these traditions did appear within the socio-religious Hindu fold. The Tantric traditions, in effect, did not reject entirely the Vedic fund of doctrines and practices. They considered it only as socially valid but unable to give liberation, which could only be attained through the complementary and higher teachings of the Tantras. 

First limited to small esoteric transgressive groups of ascetics, this teaching progressively spread to larger groups, being adopted by \(externally\) orthodox Hindu householders who, from a certain time \(perhaps the seventh or eighth century\) onward, formed the vast majority of Tantric believers. This was in spite of the fact that Tantric teachings are esoteric and in principle meant only for initiates, initiation \( *dīkṣā* \) being theoretically the necessary first step toward liberation—a liberation giving both *mukti* \(liberation\) and *bhukti* \(the enjoyment of mundane or supramundane rewards or supernatural powers\) and, of course, to be enjoyed while still living: a *jīvanmukti* . The Tantric *jīvanmukta* , the liberated in this life, is not only free from this world, but he also dominates it magically. 

In the course of time, Tantric traditions developed, expanded, and diversified. As they spread, their notions and ritual practices progressively permeated the whole Hindu world, so much so that for the last thousand years, there has been practically no Hindu tradition entirely devoid of Tantric elements. The Hindu worship, the *pūjā* , for instance, is Tantric in its conception and ritual process, the principles of Hindu temple building and iconography are Tantric, and so on. The Tantric domain penetrated also the social and political field. It spread to the whole Indian subcontinent and South Asia. Its textually most active period was \(approximately\) from the eighth to the fourteenth centuries. One of its main centers in the Indian subcontinent was in Kashmir, where several important Śaiva traditions appeared, such as the Spanda, Krama, Pratyabhijñā, or Trika. Abhinavagupta, one of the most remarkable and brilliant Indian philosophers and mystics, the master of the Trika, was from Kashmir \(fl . c. 975–1025\). 

Among the Kashmiri nondualist systems and forming one of the four “transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \) of the Kula is the Śrīvidyā, whose main deity is Tripurasundarī, the supreme goddess of the YH. 

## YH
The YH is a very typical text of Tantric Hinduism and embodies archetypal characteristics. As is often the case in such works, its esoteric teaching is expounded in a dialogue between two deities, the Goddess Tripurasundarī \(or Mahātripurasundarī\), “The Beautiful \[Mistress\] of the Three Cities” \(or “Fortresses”\)—of the three worlds, [^2] that is— who questions, and the god Bhairava, a fearsome form of Śiva, who answers her in the form of these teachings. 

[^2]: The world is traditionally considered as threefold: sky, air, and earth. This is an ancient Indian notion. There are also other threefold cosmic divisions.

### Tripurasundarī
Tripurasundarī, a beautiful, auspicious \(and erotic\) form of the great Hindu Goddess, is the main deity of an important Tantric Śaiva tradition, often called *śrīvidyā* because such is the name of her main or root mantra \( *mūlamantra* \). [^3] 


[^3]: Or rather, in the present case, *mūlavidyā* , since the goddess is feminine. A *vidyā* is a feminine mantra—the mantra, that is, of a female deity. Mantra/ *vidyā* and deity are, in fact, identical.

The term *śrīvidyā* , however, is not usual in ancient works and has come to be used mainly to refer to a modern form of this tradition, which \(as we shall see\) is still active in India today. It is therefore better to call this system the tradition of Tripurā \( *traipura-darśana* or *traipura-saṁpradāya* , [^4] in Sanskrit, the doctrine or tradition of Tripurā\), as is done in most texts. 

[^4]: For the reader who might be surprised by the shift in Sanskrit terms from *i* to *ai* \( *Śiva* to *Śaiva* , *Tripura* to *Traipura* \), let us explain that in Sanskrit, the adjectival form of a verbal or nominal root is made by adding an *a* , hence *tri* \+ *a = trai*.

We shall do this here. It is also sometimes referred to as *saubhāgya-sampradāya* , the *śrīvidyā* being sometimes called *saubhāgya-vidyā. Saubhāgya* means good fortune, happiness, and success, in addition to beauty and charm; all of these terms evoke an important aspect of this goddess and therefore of this tradition. 

The name Tripurasundarī is often explained as referring to that goddess’s character as “Mother” [^5] of various triads—all the more so when the exegetes of the system interpret it in the spirit of the Kashmirian Śaiva nondualist system of the Trika, the “Triad” \(which happens to be the case of Amṛtānanda, whose commentary on the YH we follow here when trying to elucidate this sometimes obscure text\). 

[^5]: Though very often called “Mother,” the Hindu goddess in her various forms and names, is not a “mother-goddess.” She has no children \(or, at any rate, does not give birth to them normally\). Tripurasundarī has Bhairava as a consort but is not married to him.

She is also Kāmeśvarī, associated with Kāmeśvara as the Mistress and the Master of Love. [^6] 

[^6]: There are *ardhanārī* , half-female, half-male images of this divine pair.

Tripurasundarī is sometimes called Lalitā. She is also considered as one of the ten Mahāvidyāṣ, or Nityās, [^7] in which case she is sometimes named ṣoḍaśī\(“Sixteenth”\) or even Śrīvidyā. 

[^7]: On this group of deities, see David Kinsley, Tantric Visions of the Divine: The Ten Mahāvidyās \(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997\).



There exist, too, such aspects of her as Tripura-bhairavī or Bala-tripura-sundarī. Indian deities commonly have many aspects, corresponding to different characters or aspects of the deity, auspicious or fearsome, receiving different types of worship. In the auspicious form that she has in the YH, she is usually shown as a beautiful shining woman, three-eyed, with the waxing moon on her forehead, wearing a red garment, seated on a lotus, holding in her four hands goad and arrow, bow and noose. 

### Cult Origins
There are very few stone images of Tripurasundarī, but there are many paintings. Her worship is done using the *śrīcakra* , and no concrete image is used, but during the ritual, she is to be visualized by the officiating adept as described in the texts. 


As is frequent in India, next to nothing is known of the origins of the tradition of Tripurā. It goes back probably to the tenth or eleventh century a.d. It has survived until our day and has produced important and interesting works well into the modern period. 

#### Texts
As far as we know, its two oldest [[4]] and most basic texts are the *Vāmakeśvara* / *Vāmakeśvarīmata* Tantra \(VM\), also known as the *Nityā-ṣodaśikārṇava* \(NṣA\) and the YH. These works may date from the tenth or eleventh century. It seems that a passage of the VM was quoted by Abhinavagupta \(11th c.\) in two of his works, the *Parātrīśikavivaraṇa* and the *Mālinī vijayavārttika* ; and Jayaratha, who lived in the twelfth century and wrote a commentary on the VM, mentions several earlier commentators on this Tantra, one of whom may have lived as far back as the ninth century. But there is no proof of this. 

#### Images
There also does not seem to exist any iconographical evidence of Tripurā’s worship before the tenth or eleventh century. It has indeed been suggested that an allusion to the *śrīvidyā* and perhaps to the *śrīcakra* is to be found in the South Indian Tamil work *Tirumantiram* , which some scholars date as far back as the seventh or eighth century. This, however, remains to be proved. 

There is also a belief in the modern Śrīvidyā tradition that a *śrīcakra* was installed in Sṛṅgeri, together with an image of the goddess Śāradā, by Śaṅkarācārya \(8th c.\). But this is mere imagining.+++(4)+++ 

#### Śaiva systems
The tradition of Tripurā is one of the four “transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \) of the vast Kula \(or Kaula\) ensemble of Tantric Śaiva systems that developed from the earlier Śaiva fund of beliefs and practices based
- on the so-called *kāpālika* form of practice, 
- on traditions in which the fearsome Bhairava was the main deity. 

The basic form of observance \( *vrata* \) was that of the skull \( *kāpālavrata* \), [^8] and the worship was carried out in cremation grounds \( *śmaśāna* \). 

[^8]: This observance consisted for the practitioner in wandering while carrying a skull-topped staff and an alms bowl fashioned of a human cranium.

These cults may have originated in northern India, perhaps in Kashmir. 

They were visionary transgressive cults whose adepts were possessed by the deity and in which the main deity, male or female, was surrounded by secondary deities reflecting his or her power and pervading the cosmos with their \(usually fearsome\) energy. These secondary female deities, the Yoginīs, were considered to be grouped in lineages \( *gotra* \), clans, or families \( *kula* \), hence the name Kula given to this religious ensemble. 

#### Domestication 
In the course of time, the earlier transgressive practices tended to be replaced by more staid ones, the main adepts being henceforth usually householders of pure castes rather than skull-bearing ascetics. The ancient Tantras, their terminology, and their deities were, however, retained but tended to be symbolically interpreted. The actual performance of the most “Tantric” rites \(the sexual ones in particular\) was now limited to a few religious “virtuosi,” and possession \( *āveśa* \) by the deity was replaced by mystical union or fusion \( *samāveśa* , although the term *āveśa* continued to be used\) of the adept’s consciousness with [[5]] the divine Absolute. This combination of Tantric visionary elements with an intellectual and mystical approach is clearly visible in the YH and still more in its commentaries and also in other texts of the Tripurā tradition \(or in other Kula systems\). 

#### āmnāya-s
The kula ensemble of traditions is traditionally divided into four “transmissions” \( *āmnāya* \), named according to the points of the compass: eastern \( *pūrva* \), northern \( *uttara* \), western \( *paścima* \), and southern \( *dakṣiṇa* \). [^9] 

[^9]: The best description of the *āmnāya* system and, more generally, of the Śaiva traditions is that of Alexis Sanderson, “Śaivism and the Tantric Traditions,” in Stewart Sutherland et al., eds, *The World’s Religions* \(London: Routledge, 1981\), pp. 606–704.

##### pūrvāmnāya

The *pūrvāmnāya* \( *pūrva* being understood both as eastern and as primary or earlier\) was perhaps the original *kula* system. It includes a number of elements \( *pīṭhas* , [^10] lineages, coded language, rituals, etc.\), which are found in all four transmissions; we shall see some of them here. The worship included sexual rites. 


[^10]: On the *pīṭhas* , see note 22 of chapter 1 below.

The Trika system, the Kashmirian and best known of the Śaiva nondualist traditions, seems to have developed mainly from this *āmnāya* . So does the Spanda, “Vibration.” The Trika has long since disappeared as a living religious tradition but has survived to this day as the Kashmirian main form of nondualist shaivism. 

##### uttarāmnāya
The *uttarāmnāya* , the Northern transmission, is that of the Kālī cults. It included three traditions. 

- One is the Mata \(the “Doctrine”\), of which very little is known and which has disappeared. 
- Another is the Krama \(the “Sequence”\), so called because its pantheon and its worship are organized in sequences or phases \( *krama* \). In it, the Goddess dominates Bhairava. A number of Krama texts have survived; some are edited. Abhinavagupta included *krama* elements in his Trika, as did many Śaiva authors, including commentators on the YH. 
- The third tradition is that of the worship of the fearsome goddess GuhyaKālī , which survives in Nepal as the worship of Guhyeśvarī. 

##### paścimāmnāya
The *paścimāmnāya* , the Western transmission, has as its main deity the hunchbacked goddess Kubjikā, with the beautiful mantra god Navātman as consort. Its main text is the *Kubjikāmatatantra* \(which is edited\). Here, too, the goddess is placed above her consort. 

##### dakṣināmnāya
Finally, the *dakṣināmnāya* , the Southern transmission, is the one to which the YH belongs. Its chief deity is Kāmeśvarī, goddess of erotic pleasure \(with Kāmeśvara as consort\), or Tripurasundarī \(with Bhairava\). 

It is \(or was\) in many respects a cult of erotic magic, as appears notably in the VM/NṣA. Its main characteristic is the use in ritual and meditation of a particular diagram, the *śrīcakra* , and of a particular mantra, the *śrīvidyā* . It is probably the most recent of the four *āmnāyas* . It has lasted until today, producing several interesting works. 

It does not seem to have divided into [[6]] different schools. There are, however, at least since the thirteenth century, two different lineages, with two different forms of the *śrīvidyā* \(as we shall see\). Variants also appeared. There is in particular a modern South Indian Śrīvidyā, based in Sṛṅgeri, very largely “vedantized” and “de-Tantricized,” which is, however, not socially unimportant since it has been adopted by the Śaṅkarācāryas. [^11]

[^11]: This tradition has been studied by Douglas R. Brooks, notably in Auspicious Wisdom: The Texts and Traditions of Śrīvidyā, Śākta Tantrism in South India \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1992\).

##### Common elements
As we have seen, the four *āmnāyas* have diff erent main deities, different pantheons and mantras, and so on; however, because of their common Śaiva *kāpālika* origin, they have, if not exactly a common esoteric core, at least a common fund of metaphysical \(and sometimes theological\) notions or doctrines, or ritual or spiritual practices, expressed by using a common vocabulary, such as the use of the term *kula* and its derivatives \( *akula* , *kaula* , *kaulika* \). Some mantras, too, are common to different *āmnāyas.* 

### Cult books
Although it is still the most active tradition of the Kula, the Tripurā tradition is little known outside India. There is, as far as we know, no complete and systematic study of its vast literature.[^12] 

[^12]:

    There is Brooks’s study quoted above and also his *The Secret of the Three Cities. *
    
    *An Introduction to Hindu Śākta Tantrism* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990\). Though informative, these two books do not cover the vast area of texts of the Tripurā tradition of the *dakṣiṇāmnāya.* 



This includes, among earlier authors, such people as Puṇyānanda, who was the master of Amṛtānanda, who often refers to his *Kāma-kalā-vilāsa* , [^13] and Śivānanda or Vidyānanda, both of whom commented on the YH but also wrote various ritual, theological, or philosophical works. Later came Lakṣmīdhara \(16th c.\) and the polymath Bhāskararāya \(c. a.d. 1700\), who wrote a commentary on the YH to which we sometimes refer here; Kaśināthabhaṭṭa is also worth mentioning. 

[^13]: Edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in the *Tantrik Texts* , first published in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\).

The tradition includes such works as the vast mythical and speculative *Tripurā-rahasya* , a number of Tantras or Tantric compilations such as the *Gandharva-tantra* , the *Tantra-rāja* , the *Tripurārṇava* , the *Śakti-saṅgama* , the *Vidyārṇava* , and so on. 

There are Upaniṣads, too, such as the *Tripurā* , the *Tripurā-tāpinī* , or the *Bhāvanopaṇiṣad* . 

Very important from the ritual point of view is the *Paraśu-rāma-kalpa-sūtra* \(where the goddess is Lalitā\), commented on by Umānanda in the *Nityotsava* \(1745\) and then by Rameśvara in 1831. 

A number of other works—digests, ritual manuals, hymns, and so on—would deserve mentioning. [^14] 

[^14]: The *Subhagodaya* and the *Subhagodayavāsanā* of Śivānanda or the *Jñānadīpavimarśinī* of Vidyānanda, for instance.


Of these, we only refer to one of the best known, the *Saundaryalaharī* , traditionally attributed to Śaṅkarācārya. 


### Origins
No precise information can be given on the origin of the YH or on that of its parent text, the VM/NṣA. No ancient manuscript has been found. Abhinavagupta \(c. 975–1025\) does not mention its name, nor does [[7]] Jayaratha \(12th c.\) in his commentary on the *Tantrāloka* \(TĀ\). It is not one of the sixty-four Bhairavatantras listed by him when commenting on TĀ 1.18, nor is it quoted or alluded to in other lists of the Śaiva canon. 

A *Yoginīhr̥daya* is indeed mentioned in a Nepalese manuscript of the eleventh century, but we do not know if this text is the same as the one we have now; it is probably not. 

Amṛtānanda, who lived probably in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, says in his commentary on the YH, the *Dīpikā* \(Dī \), that his was the first one made on that work. But surely, if the YH were by then an ancient work, other commentaries would have existed. All of this makes it very unlikely that the date of the YH is earlier than the eleventh century, and it might well be later. 

There are many reasons for believing that the Tripurā tradition originated in northwestern India, more specifically in Kashmir. 

- Jayaratha, who was certainly a Kashmiri, mentions in his commentary on the VM two masters as having introduced this *darśana* into Kashmir, and he appears to believe that there was a long tradition of local exegesis. 
- Śivānanda, the thirteenth- or fourteenth-century commentator on the same text, explains certain peculiarities of the *śrīvidyā* as being a result of the Kashmirian origin of the tradition. 

Of course, the fact that Jayaratha mentions the tradition as having been brought down into Kashmir \( *kaśmireṣu avatārakam* \) may mean that it came from elsewhere, and some scholars believe it originated farther northwest, not far from Kashmir, in Uḍḍiyāna, the valley of Swat \(now in Pakistan\), a region often, but perhaps rather mythically, quoted as the place of origin of several Śaiva Tantric practices or traditions. 

Central India, too, has sometimes been named as the birthplace of this tradition. [^15] 

[^15]: This was done by Pdt. V. V. Dvivedi in the introduction \(in Hindi\) of his edition of the YH. The hypothesis does not lack probability. Abhinavagupta mentions central India \(*madhyadeśa*\) as the seat of all the Śaiva treatises \( *niḥ-śeṣa-śāstra-sadanam* \). This remains to be proved.

All of this is possible. The metaphysics and the vocabulary of the YH, however, are so close to those of the post-scriptural Śaiva texts, and especially to those of the later Pratyabhijñā [^16] as expounded by Kṣemarāja, that its Kashmirian origin seems very likely. \(But since a number of authors on the tradition, such as Puṇyānanda, Śivānanda, and Vidyānanda, were from the south, a South Indian origin of the YH, however unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.\) 

[^16]: 

    The Pratyabhijñā \(the “Recognition”\), one of the philosophical systems of Kashmirian nondualist shaivism, was propounded first by Somānanda \(c. 900–950\), then by his disciple Utpaladeva, whose work was commented on and expanded by Abhinavagupta. It is one of the most remarkable Indian philosophical systems. 

    Its main contention is that liberation is gained by the recognition \( *pratyabhijñā* \) of the identity of the human self \( *ātman* \) and the supreme Lord, Śiva. The “transpersonal” self thus realized contains the totality of subjective and objective phenomena in a nondualistic synthesis where all distinctions disappear in the fullness of the Absolute. 

    A concise and clear presentation of the Pratyabhijñā was made by Kṣemarāja in the *Pratyabhijñāhrdaya*. It is translated into English by Jaideva Singh, Pratyabhijñāhr̥dayam, Sanskrit text with English translation and notes \(Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1963\).



The Tripurā cult was certainly present at a comparatively early date in the North Indian Himalayan area. There seem to be ancient traces of it in Nepal. Even if it began in the north, Tripurā’s cult appears to have soon spread to the south, as shown by works of such authors as those noted above. A large number of Śrīvidyā works come from the south, and the many manuscripts mostly in South Indian scripts that are found nowadays in libraries all over India testify to the comparatively early and [[8]] widespread popularity of the Tripurā cult. This fact is also interesting in that it shows the vitality and importance, from ancient times, of intellectual contacts between different parts of the Indian subcontinent. 

### Commentaries
There are two important commentaries on the YH. The earlier one is the *Dīpikā* \(“The Lamp”\) by Amṛtānanda, which we often refer to here \(abbreviating it as Dī \) since it is used as the basis of our explanation of the YH. 

The other one is the *Setubandha* by Bhāskararāya, who lived in Mysore and Varanasi at the end of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. It is a commentary on both the VM/NṣA and the YH, treating them as one and the same work. 

Amṛtānanda’s Dī interprets the YH in the spirit of the later Praty-abhijñā as developed by Kṣema-rāja, which shows that even if Amṛtānanda was South Indian, he was nevertheless steeped in the Kashmirian Śaiva nondualist tradition. 

Bhāskararāya’s *Setubandha* , on the other hand, which was finished, we are told, on the Śivaratri day of Śaka 1655 \( a.d. 1733\), is the work of a much later remarkable polymath \(more than forty works are ascribed to him\), not characteristically written in the spirit of a particular sectarian tradition but very true to the Tantric spirit of the YH. It is clear and useful. [^17] 

[^17]: It has not been translated into English. Bhāskararāya wrote a short and useful treatise on the *śrīvidyā* , the *Varivasyā-rahasya*. It was edited with an English translation in the Adyar Library Series, no. 28 \(1948\). I translated Amṛtānanda’s *Dīpikā* together with the YH in *Le coeur de la Yoginī:* Yoginīhr̥daya *avec le com-mentaire* Dīpikā *d’Amṛtānanda* \(Paris: Collège de France, 1994\)

There are other commentaries of lesser interest. 

It may be useful here to draw the reader’s attention to the fact that Indian religious or philosophical texts, often obscure or arcane or cast in brief elliptical statements, [^18] were meant to be made explicit by commentaries given orally through the teaching of masters or in written exegetical works. 

[^18]: A typical, though extreme, case of this is Pāṇini’s Sanskrit grammar, the *Aṣṭādhyāyī* , which is entirely cryptic. Its first sutra is: *vṛddhir ād aic*. ..


This is how Indian traditions appeared and developed, permitting “change in continuity.” Truth being deemed to have been proclaimed in the origins of time—or out of time—in the Veda, or by deities, nothing could be added to it except by way of commentaries and explanations. 


### Connection to Vāmakeśvara-tantra
A problem that arises concerning the text of the YH is its relationship to the VM/NṣA. The three chapters of the YH have often been considered to be the latter part of a work in eight chapters, the first five of which constitute the VM/NṣA. The YH begins with the Goddess asking Bhairava to explain to her “the many unknown elements that are in this Vāmakeśvara-tantra” \( *vāmakeśvara-tantre ‘sminn ajñātārthas anekaśaḥ* \). The YH would thus appear to be an esoteric complement to the more exoteric VM, which is a work of erotic magic and ritual, whereas the YH is mainly metaphysical and devotional, even in its third chapter on the *śrīcakrapūjā* . 

To this can be added that Amṛtānanda sometimes refers to the VM in his Dī , notably when explaining why a particular point is or is not mentioned [[9]] in the YH or in his own commentary, and that Bhāskararāya later wrote his commentary, *Setubandha* , on all eight chapters of the two texts as if they constituted a single work, and he states explicitly that the YH is the latter half of the Tantra: *tantrottarārdham.* 

There are, however, convincing reasons to believe that these two works are related but distinct texts, probably of different periods. For instance, Śivānanda and Vidyānanda never refer to the YH in their commentaries on the NṣA. Jayaratha, when commenting on the VM, mentions several earlier commentators on the same, while Amṛtānanda, in his Dī , says that he is the first to comment on the YH. 

Not only is the spirit of the two works very different, but the YH also gives the *śrīvidyā* in the so-called *hādi* form, whereas the NŚA/VM gives it in the *kādi* form. [^19] 

[^19]: On these two forms, see below.

For these reasons and several others, we believe that the VM and the YH are two different works, the VM being the earlier one and the YH being composed to complement it philosophically, which is why these two texts came, at some later period, to be considered as two sections of one work. 


### Tantricness
The Śrīvidyā or Tripurā tradition constitutes one of the “transmissions”—the *dakṣināmnāya* —of the Kula, and the YH, which is one of its basic texts, is a Tantric work. It is Tantric both in its spirit, its theology, and its metaphysics and in its ritual practices and forms of worship. 

It is Tantric in its conception of the supreme deity as inseparably male and female, Bhairava and Tripurasundarī, the latter being, theologically, the supreme goddess but metaphysically subordinated to Bhairava, who is Śiva. The Goddess is also Śakti, the divine universal power that creates and animates the cosmos in all its aspects, human, material, mundane, or supramundane, her power spreading out as a hierarchy of feminine deities or energies radiating concentrically from her; this characteristically Tantric “mandalic” aspect of the pantheon is found in the whole of South Asia. It is illustrated here by the *śrīcakra* with the deities who abide in it. 

#### Kuṇḍalinī
Also Tantric is the notion of the *kuṇḍalinī* , the divine cosmic power present in the human body. The Tantric adept lives with the image of this both human and divine power present in the image of his body, this structure of centers \( *cakras* , etc.\) or nodal points \( *granthis* \) connected by subtle tubes or channels, the *nāḍis* , where the life breath, the *prāṇa* \( *prāṇas* , rather, for they are numerous\) circulates along with the mantras. 

This structure, imagined, visualized, even sometimes “felt” as present \(“intraposed”\) within his physical body by the yogin, is usually called “subtle body” in English. We do not use this expression because it is a [[10]] misnomer. In *all* Sanskrit texts, the term *sūkṣmaśarīra* \(or *sūkṣmadeha* \), which means “subtle body,” designates not this structure but the transmigrating element in the human being, which is made up of different *tattvas* and therefore has no shape, no visible aspect. It cannot be visualized as is the inner structure of *cakras* and *nāḍis* . We call it yogic body or imaginal yogic body, not subtle body+++(5)+++. 

The presence and the meditative and ritual use of this purely mental \(but existentially perceived\) image of the body is fundamentally Tantric, even though it is used by most non-Tantric practitioners of yoga. 

#### pūjā
Also Tantric, of course, is the worship beginning with an inner \( *āntara* \), entirely mental *pūjā* , followed by the outer \( *bāhya* \) worship organized following the traditional Tantric pattern, which includes not only visualisations \( *dhyāna* \) but also yogic phases during which the officiating adept is to awaken his *kuṇḍalinī* . The *pūjā* ends with a *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* , which is, in fact, a practice of *kuṇḍalinī* yoga. The offerings made during the worship, being Tantric, include meat and alcohol. But there are no sexual rites. 

We will comment further on these Tantric aspects, and mention other ones, as they occur in the three chapters of the YH. Here we underline only a few particular points. 

#### Yoginī

The Yoginī of the title is the goddess Tripurasundarī. Amṛtānanda, in his Dī , explains that she is so called because she manifests the coming together \( *yoga* \) of all the constitutive elements of the universe. She bears this name, he says, because she is eternally in union, *yoga* , with Śiva. 

These explanations are of some value insofar as they underscore the at once transcendent and immanent nature of the Goddess Śakti and her indissoluble union with Śiva. 

The name Yoginī is also interesting as a reminder of the links between the Tripurā tradition, as an *āmnāya* of the Kula, with the ancient \(but still surviving\) Yoginī cults. This tradition having as its main deity a goddess who is the supreme power, Śakti, surrounded by a retinue of feminine secondary deities/powers— *śaktis,* which are also Yoginīs—could be called Śākta. But the so-called Śākta systems developed in a Śaiva context and are in effect Śaiva. Metaphysically, Tripurasundarī is subordinated to Paramaśiva, the supreme level of the godhead. The YH is expounded by Bhairava, the fearsome form of Śiva, in answer to a question of the Goddess. 

[[11]]

True, he does so because she orders him \(“I am ordered by You,” *tvayāham ājñaptaḥ* \), but this order is a form of his own will \( *madicchārūpayā* , 3.202\). 

As the Dī explains, the universe is the “play” \( *līlā* , *kṛḍ* \) of Śakti, but Śiva is her master. Theologically, in the devotion and worship of her devotees, the Goddess is supreme; but if Śiva and śakti are inseparable, Śiva, the masculine aspect of the total supreme godhead, is higher: śakti is Śiva’s energy. Tripurā’s tradition is therefore Śaiva. [^20] 


[^20]: 

    Other Śaiva traditions have a goddess as their main deity, such as the Kubjikā tradition or the Krama, with Kālī. The Śaiva nondualist Kashmirian system of the Trika has three supreme goddesses: Parā, Parāparā, and Aparā. 

    We may underscore here the fact that with very few exceptions, the Tantric traditions whose main deity is a goddess nevertheless hold the male divine form of the deity, usually Śiva/Bhairava, as metaphysically higher. Tantras, we must not forget, were composed by male brahmins; their extolling of the goddess or of [[165]] feminine powers were \(to quote an American anthropologist\) “male constructions of femaleness.”

Surrounded by the Yoginīs abiding in the *śrīcakra* —in the cosmos, that is— Tripurasundarī is the first of them, infusing them with her power and presiding over their activity. They emanate from her in a hierarchical order, embodying and spreading her power on all planes of the cosmos and fulfilling the functions allotted to them. As Bhairava says in YH 3.194: 

> “You alone it is, Enchantress of the worlds, who are playing under the guise of these \[deities\].” 

They are aspects \( *rūpa* \) she takes on in her cosmic play. 

In the Tantras and the Purāṇas, the Yoginīs are usually said to be sixty-four in number, which is eight times eight, that is, eight times the Eight Mothers \( *aṣṭamātaraḥ* , *aṣṭamātṛkā* \). [^21] 

[^21]: The *mātṛkās* are either seven, the *saptamātṛkā* , or eight \(*aṣṭamātṛkā* or *matāṣṭaka* \). The number eight is important in Tantric texts. Eight times eight is the \(theoretical\) number of Bhairava Tantras. Sixty-four is also four times sixteen, which is an important lunar number, the number of fullness. Sixteen is also the number of the Nityās, the first of which is Tripurasundarī\(see YH 3:113\); and the name of the VM/NṣĀ, *Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava* , means “The Ocean of the Sixteen Nityās.”

In the third chapter \(3.193\), the YH multiplies this number by ten million, mentioning sixty-four crores [^22] of Yoginīs, to be worshipped in an eightfold ritual. In the *śrīcakra* , however, although they are in eight groups \(plus the Goddess\), corresponding to the structure of the diagram, they number seventy-eight. Their names also are not those usually found in the Purāṇas. 

[^22]: A *crore* \( *koṭi* \) is ten million.

#### Hṛdaya

The great secret \(*mahā-guhya*\) disclosed to initiates by the YH is the *Yoginī-hr̥daya* , the “Heart of the Yoginī,” by which is meant the supreme reality, the supreme divine plane where the Goddess, consciousness \(of\) itself, manifests her power and her glory. She does this by means of the *śrīcakra* and the *śrīvidyā* , which are not a mere ritual diagram and a mere mantra but her visual, or diagrammatic, and her phonic form, two aspects of her cosmic creative \(and destructive\) power.+++(4)+++ 

The heart as the supreme reality, as the spiritual plane, and as the center in the human body \(or, more exactly, in the image of the body\) where this reality is revealed and experienced is an ancient Indian notion. 

It was taken over and developed in nondualist shaivism by such authors as Utpaladeva, Abhinavagupta, and Kṣemarāja, who described it in his commentary on the Śiva-sūtras as being “the light of consciousness since it is the place where everything abides” \( *viśva-pratiṣṭha-sthānatvāt cit-prakāśohr̥dayam* \). He also describes it as throbbing and flashing consciousness [[12]] \( *sphurantīṁ saṁvidam* \) or as both made of the world and transcending it \( *viśvātmakaṁ taduttīrṇam* \). It is therefore the total plenitude of the godhead as mystically experienced in one’s heart. [^23] \(We must not forget that in traditional India, the center of consciousness is in the heart, not in the brain.\) 



[^23]: On the Śaiva nondualist conceptions of the heart, see Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega, The Triadic Heart of Śiva \(Albany: SUNY Press, 1989\).


#### Mudra

*Mudrās* do not play a fundamental role in the YH. Their case, however, needs to be mentioned here because of the particular conception of *mudrās* in Tantric texts. They are not mere symbolical gestures evoking a deity or some person or entity, object, or feeling, as is true of the *mudrās* \(or *hastas* \) of dance or theater. They are both evocative/invocative gestures and—in the case of deities or powers—the supernatural entity they evoke or symbolize. They are both bodily gestures or attitudes by which the performer invokes and makes present \(and, up to a point, identifies with\) the entities they symbolize *and* these very entities.+++(4)+++ 

The nine *mudrās* described in *śl* . 59–61 of the first chapter of the YH are nine deities, ancillary goddesses of Tripurasundarī made present by a gesture whose performance \(together with the mental visualization\) identifies the adept with that deity.\(Such deities are to be worshipped during the *śrīcakra pūjā* , as we shall see in the third chapter.\) 

Gestures are an important element in human communication. They play a role in support of language. They also supplement it. In ritual, they have meaning and power, and they act, usually by accompanying a mantra but also sometimes by their own visual/bodily power; this appears clearly here in chapter 1. 

For many texts, *mudrās* are more than gesture; they are mystical attitudes, and in practicing them, the yogin identifies with a deity or even with the absolute. Such is the case, for instance, with the *mudrās* described in the *Vijñāna-bhairava* or those described in chapter 32 of Abhinavagupta’s *Tantrāloka* , where he explains that the *mudrā* , together with the mental concentration of the adept, brings about the presence of the deity invoked and identifies the adept with it. 

### Metaphysics

The philosophical conceptions of the YH can be said to be those of the nondualist Kashmirian shaivism, and especially those of the *pratyabhijñā* -based [[13]] Trika as expounded notably by Abhinavagupta. This is one more reason for believing the YH to have been elaborated, if not in Kashmir, then at least, and certainly, in circles where the Kashmirian Śaiva tradition was active. 

The supreme reality \( *paramaṁ mahat* , *mahātattva* , or *mahāsattā* , the “Great Being”\) is described as transcendent, undivided \( *niṣkala* , 1.27\), transcending space and time, pure light \( *prakāśa* , 1.11\), [^24] and consciousness \( *saṁvit* , 1.10\). It is also the phoneme *A* , the “unsurpassed” or “peerless one” \( *anuttara* \). 


[^24]: But a light that is consciousness, a conscious light.


This absolute flashes forth, vibrates luminously \( *sphurattā* , *ullāsa* \). It expands as a luminous wave \( *sphuradūrmi* , 1.10\) by its own free will \( *svecchayā* , 1.9\) and manifests thus the whole cosmos made up of the thirty-six *tattvas* , from Śiva to the earth \( *pṛthivī* , 2.32–33\). This universe, manifested [^25] as if by play \( *līlā* \), is pervaded by the divine power or energy; everything, from the gods to this earthly world, is in fact the Goddess herself, supreme splendor \( *paraṁ tejas* , 1.72\), “surrounded by the sparkling waves of her multitudinous energies” \(1.55\). 


[^25]: We say “manifested” rather than “created,” for in a nondualist system, the deity does not create outwardly the world; she manifests, causes to appear outwardly \(though in herself\), the cosmos, which is in seed in herself. There is no *fiat* taking place at the beginning of time; creation as manifestation is being eternally, perpetually manifested by the godhead who pervades and animates it—otherwise, it would disappear.+++(4)+++

Of this manifestation, the Goddess is luminously conscious \( *prakāṣāmarśana* \) as it unfolds “on the screen of her own self” \( *ātmabhittau* , 1.56\). She vibrates \( *spandarūpiṇī* \), being immersed in bliss \( *ānanda* \). Although transcendent \( *viśvottīrṇa* \), the Goddess as supreme power \( *paramaśakti* \) is also immanent, “made of the world” \( *viśvamaya* \), that is, embodied in everything that exists. The cosmos is her manifested form, but although she is shining, “Flame of the essence of divine play” \( *divyakrīd rasojjvala* , 2.76\) as the absolute, she is ever pure, undivided light and bliss. All these notions and the terms used are typical of nondualist shaivism. 

## Practice-focus
The YH, however, is not a philosophical treatise aiming at expounding particular metaphysical tenets. Neither was that the aim of the Dī , in spite of the fact that its interpretation of the sutras always develops their metaphysical import. The aim of this text \(and of practically all Indian metaphysical systems\) [^26] was, while conveying an esoteric teaching, to show a way toward liberation—more precisely to a Tantric form of liberation in this life, *jīvanmukti* , which is both liberation from the fetters of this world and domination over it. This is the raison d’être of the three chapters of the YH. 

[^26]: Indian philosophical systems, like the classical Western \(Greek\) philosophies, are not abstract theoretical constructions but ways of life, traditions to live by.

## Cakrasaṁketa
Chapter 1:* Cakrasaṁketa \(86 ślokas \)* *

### On śrīcakra
The YH does not say here how to draw the *śrīcakra* \(nor does Amṛtānanda in the Dī \). It describes how it appears as an outward manifestation of the power of the Goddess, who is deemed to have agreed with her consort, Śiva, to be present with him in the *śrīcakra* , hence the title of the chapter, *Cakrasaṁketa* . What is described is a cosmic process bringing about the existence of the *cakra* that embodies this process and mediates it to the *sādhaka* who is to visualize mentally its aspect and its dynamism through an intense identifying form of meditation called *bhāvanā* . [^27] 

[^27]: *Bhāvanā* is a very important practice in the universe of Tantra. The term is derived from the causative form of the Sanskrit verbal root *BHU* , to cause to exist \( *bhāvyate* \). It designates a practice consisting of evoking mentally the image of a deity with the same precision as a concrete image or creating, by calling it intensely to mind, any image, vision, or thought, thus identifying the meditating person with the subject or theme being meditated. It differs from *dhyāna* in its intensity and identifying power and in the fact that it creates its object, which is not necessarily the case in *dhyāna*. +++(भेदोऽयं कृत्रिमो भाति।)+++ Its role is fundamental in Tantric mental practices, spiritual life, and ritual. As is well known, in Tantrism, *dhyāna* designates meditation but also, and more important, the mental visualization of a deity as described in stanzas of ritual manuals called *dhyānaślokas*. 

### Unfolding of śrīcakra
After presenting the dialogue, in the Absolute, between the Goddess and Bhairava, which makes up the text of the YH, the chapter first describes the cosmic unfolding of the *śrīcakra* from the central *bindu* to the outer square \( *śl* . 10–21\). 


### Oral domain
Then the adept, following a reverse movement, since he is a human being, is to visualize and perceive within himself the three main constituent parts of the *cakra* , going from the outer square to the center. Now, once the meditation of the *sādhaka* has reached the central *bindu* , he is to evoke and follow mentally the ascending levels of phonic energy \(the *kalās* , “parts”\), from *ardhacandra* to *unmanā* , of the utterance \( *uccāra* \) [^28] of the *bīja HRĪṂ* , the basic mantra of the Goddess. 

[^28]: *Uccāra* is an utterance of a mantra that is both an enunciation and an upward thrust of the phonic subtle sound, the *nāda* , of the mantra in the body of the mantrin. This ascending phonic movement is often associated with the ascent of *kuṇḍalinī* along the *suṣumnā* ; it is more a yogic practice than a verbal enunciation. This is, notably, the case of the *japa* of the *śrīvidyā* described in the third chapter \( *śl*. 169–188\) of the YH.

The mental process goes thus from the spatial, visual domain of the diagram to the oral one, as if sound were felt as a subtle extension of space. The adept is to meditate there on three planes of the Word, *vāc* , from the supreme, *parā* , to the intermediate, *madhyamā* , [^29] and to evoke the fifty phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet while also meditating such entities as *pīṭhas* or *liṅgas* \( *śl* . 37–49\). 

[^29]: On the levels of *vāc* , see chapter 2, *śl.* 63, and n. 25 ad loc.

### mudrā
He is to conceive the *śrīcakra* as being the universe produced by the will \( *icchā* \) of the deity, a will that is eventually to become action \( *kriyā* \) and which is then *mudrā* “because it rejoices \[ *mud* \] the universe and makes it flow \[ *rā* \].” [^30] 

[^30]: See the commentary and notes to *śl*. 1.57.

Stanzas 57–71 then describe ten *mudrās* that are both ritual hand gestures and aspects of the Goddess, corresponding also to the nine parts of the *śrīcakra* \(and to its entirety\). The *mudrās* symbolize or, more accurately, are actually stages in the progression of the *sādhaka* from the outer world where he lives to the godhead. 

Other meditations on the *śrīcakra* are then prescribed, all meant to help the adept to realize the metaphysical import of the diagram as the form the Goddess takes on in her cosmic creative \(and destructive\) play; added to the preceding ones, this *bhāvanā* will lead him to liberation. 

## Mantrasaṁketa
* Chapter 2:* Mantrasaṁketa \(85 ślokas \) 

### Clusters
Although this chapter is entirely based on the phonetic pattern of the *śrīvidyā* \(in which the Goddess and Śiva have agreed to meet; this is the *saṁketa* of the chapter’s name\), its syllabic composition—its [[15]] “extraction,” *uddhāra* , [^31] as it is usually called—is not given. 

[^31]: The *uddhāra* of a mantra is the ritual procedure by which one “extracts”\( *ud-DHRī*\) its constituent syllables from the ensemble of the Sanskrit [[166]] alphabet, this being displayed, according to particular rules, on a consecrated surface or placed in a particular order in a diagram called *prastāra* \(“display”\) or *gahvara* \(“cavern” or “hiding place”\). This permits revealing the composition of the mantra only to initiates who know how to “extract” the syllables thus hidden. The *uddhāra* can also consist of listing the syllables of a mantra, giving them conventional, theoretically secret names, or by alluding esoterically to them.

In this, the YH differs from its parent text, the NṣA, which does give it. It appears, however, that the *śrīvidyā* is considered to be made up of fifteen syllables grouped in three clusters, as follows: 

- *HA SA KA LA HRĪṂ* 
- *HA SA HA KA LA HRĪṂ* 
- *SA KA LA HRĪṂ* . 

This is, as we have said, the *śrīvidyā* in the so-called *hādi* form, because it begins with *HA* . There is also another form, called *kādi* \(because the fi rst cluster begins with *KA* \): *KA E I LA HRĪṂ* . These two forms are used in two Tripurā traditions called, respectively, *hādi-mata* and *kādi-mata* , which seem to have existed from comparatively ancient times since they are mentioned by such authors as Śivānanda \(13th c.\). [^32] 

[^32]: There are, in fact, various other forms, made of three clusters but of varying length, quoted notably in Purṇānanda’s *Śrītattvacintāmaṇi*.

The three clusters of the *śrīvidyā* are called *kūṭa* , which means “summit” or “group”; they are also called *bīja* or *piṇḍa* . 

### Meanings
The *mantrasaṁketa*’s purpose is to give six different “meanings” \( *artha* \) by means of allegorical symbolical interpretations of its syllables—that is, to expound six different ways to understand, perceive, and experiment by *bhāvanā* its inner nature and hidden meaning, a practice that will lead the *sādhaka* toward liberation. These interpretations are abstruse and often far-fetched, and we have not always understood them in spite of help received from Professor V. V. Dvivedi of Varanasi. 

### Mantras
The chapter begins by enumerating the *vidyās* \(i.e., mantras\) of the nine *cakreśvarīs* , the regent deities of the nine parts of the *śrīcakra* , which the adept must place by *nyāsa* on nine parts of his yogic body and worship there as present in the nine constitutive *cakras* of the *śrīcakra.* 

### bhāvārtha
Then is expounded the first *artha* , the *bhāvārtha* \( *śl.* 16–25\). It is based on symbolical values given to the syllables of the *vidyā* , the three parts of which are described as resulting from the union of Śiva and Śakti, from whose interactive union \( *saṁghaṭṭa* \) [^33] the “flow,” the creative play of the mantra, is deemed to issue. 

[^33]: On this important term, see YH 1.67 and its commentary.

This very flow expressed by the phonetic constituents of the *śrīvidyā* , manifests, sustains, animates, and ultimately reabsorbs the cosmos, a process the adept must experience spiritually through a *bhāvanā* in which the three parts of the mantra are experienced as fused with his *kuṇḍalinī* . The power of the *vidyā* also takes on here the form of the *kāmakalā* \( *śl* . 21–25\), a diagram whose symbolism, based on the sexual union of Śiva and Śakti, is both visual and phonic. [^34] 


[^34]: The basic work on the *kāmakalā* is Puṇyānanda’s *Kāmakalāvilāsa* , which was edited and translated by Arthur Avalon in 1922 \(reprint Madras: Ganesh & Co., 1953\). A careful and interesting study of this diagram is found in chapter 4 of David G. White’s *Kiss of the Yoginī: “Tantric Sex” in Its South Asian Contexts* \(Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003\).

### saṁpradāya artha
The *saṁpradāya artha* , the “traditional meaning” \( *śl* . 26–48\) shows how the cosmic process is pervaded by the *śrīvidyā* , that is, by the united Śiva and Śakti. To this effect, the YH explains how the constitutive elements of [[16]] the universe— *tattvas, guṇas* , *prāṇas* , and so forth, even the gods—come to be manifested. All of this is grasped and experienced by *bhāvanā* . 

### nigarbha artha
The *nigarbha artha*, the “inner meaning,” very briefly considered,\( *śl* . 48–51\), is the essential oneness of Śiva, the guru, and the self of the *sādhaka* , who is to realize it by *bhāvanā* , thanks also to his devotion and to the power of the guru’s gaze \( *nirīkṣaṇa* \). [^35] 

[^35]: *Nirīkṣaṇa* , also called *dṛṣṭipāta* \(“the casting of a glance”\), as a means to influence, harm, or else help spiritually, plays an important role in Indian religious or magic practice. The compassionate glance of the guru helps his disciple.

### kaulikārtha
The *kaulikārtha* , the Kula meaning of the *vidyā* \( *śl* . 51–68\), is meant to bring about a realization by the adept of the essential oneness of the *cakra* , the godhead, the *vidyā* , the guru, and his own self. The *śrīcakra* is shown as being born from the phonemes of the *vidyā* ; as being the cosmic, essential body \( *vapus* \) of the Goddess; and as having the *vidyā* as its essential nature. The Goddess is described as present in the cosmos as five different groups of divine aspects or entities, Yoginīs and so on. The adept is to realize and experience by *bhāvanā* that all of this is present in the *cakra* and in the *vidyā* and in his own body and that of the guru. To realize this is to gain liberation. 

### sarva-rahasya
The *sarva-rahasya* , the “most secret of all” *arthas* \( *śl* . 69–72\), is secret because it is a most direct way to fusion with the godhead. It is a *kuṇḍalinī* yoga practice where the parts of the *śrīvidyā* , the fifty Sanskrit phonemes, and the thirty-eight cosmic *kalās* are interiorized by the adept and made to ascend with his *kuṇḍalinī* . He thus experiences a cosmic pervasion lead-ing to liberation. 

### mahātattva artha
Finally, the *mahātattva artha* , the one concerning the highest reality \( *śl* . 73–80\), is the nondual realization of the Absolute “in the flashing forth of the essence of the divine play.” This *artha* is meant for the “heroes”\( *vīra* \), followers of the *kaulācāra* , the practice of Kula, who participate in the ritual meetings of the Yoginīs \( *yoginīmelana* \). The practice described here seems to be mainly meditative, not actually sexual. It shows, however, the surviving links of the Tripurā tradition with the earlier *kāpālika* Kula practices, an aspect that the adepts of the South Indian Śrīvidyā later tried to blot out. 

## Pūjāsaṁketa
* Chapter 3:* Pūjāsaṁketa \(204 ślokas \) 

This chapter is the longest of the YH. It accounts for more than half of the work. Although the Goddess is to be visualized during the worship, which is performed on the *śrīcakra* without any material icon, she is not described here as she is, for instance, in *śl* . 130–146 of the first chapter of the NṣA. Only her theological and metaphysical traits as the supreme [[17]] deity are given. 

Tripurasundarī, in NṣA, is described as a beautiful young woman, luminous like the rising sun, having three eyes, a half-moon on her forehead, and a crown of jewels on her hair. She wears gold brace-lets, is clad in a red garment, and is seated on a lotus. She holds in her two upper hands a noose \( *pāśa* \) and an elephant-goad \( *aṅkuśa* \) and in her two lower hands a bow \( *dhanus* \) and arrows \( *bāṇa* \). These four attributes are quoted in YH 1.53 as those of Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī, who, taken together, are forms of Tripurasundarī. 

### Rites
The first *pūjā* described is the *nityāpūjā*, the worship all Hindus must perform daily. Some are occasional \( *naimittika* \) rites, and a few are optional \( *kāmya* \). [^36] 

[^36]: 

    Hindu rites are traditionally divided into three classes. 

    *Nitya* , “regular,” are daily and mandatory rites; their performance does not bring any merit, but not to perform them is a fault. 

    The *naimittika* , “occasional,” rites are obligatory but are to be performed on particular prescribed occasions; they bring merit. 

    *Kāmya,* “optional,” rites are undertaken to attain desired aims; mantric rites are *kāmya* , as are, of course, all “magical” rites.

It is not described in full detail, except for the *nyāsa* and the *japa* , two rites meant to identify the officiating adept with the deity. Some rites are hardly dealt with. 

The YH underscores the parts of the ritual that aim more specifically at helping the *sādhaka* to identify with the godhead, which is the raison d’être of the YH but which is an essential aspect of Tantric worship. Its performance is a means, if not to gain, at least to progress - toward liberation. 

### Divinization
In fact, no Tantric worship may be performed if one is not already divinized by a preliminary ritual. It is said, *nādevo devam arcayet* \(“One who is not God must not worship God”\). But although he is thus already ritually divinized, the officiant must still perform during the worship several rites that will advance him toward the goal of identification with the deity he worships. [^37] 

[^37]: 

    On the practice and spirit of the Tantric Śaiva worship, see Richard H. Davis, Ritual in an Oscillating Universe: Worshipping Śiva in Medieval India \(Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press\), especially the chapter titled “Becoming a Śiva.” 

    This book is a study of dualist shaivism, for which only ritual liberates one from the fetters of this world, a conception opposed to that of nondualist shaivism and therefore of the YH. The rites are, however, generally the same.

In such a view, the ritual is seen more as a spiritual exercise than as a mere worship of the deity. 

### Levels
This explains why the chapter begins by saying that there are three sorts of *pūjā* , the lowest of which is the ritually performed one. 

The highest one \( *śl* . 3a, 4b–7\), the “supreme worship,” is purely spiritual. It is a *bhāvanā* associated with an ascent of the *kuṇḍalinī* , by which the adept experiences mystically his unity with the supreme Śiva. It is the total plenitude of the absolute I \( *pūrṇāhaṁbhava* \), an experience of the nature of the Goddess as the flashing forth of consciousness. 

The second sort is “nonsupreme”\( *apara* \). It is the *cakrapūja* as described in this chapter. Bhairava says here \( *śl* . 3b\) that he performs it ceaselessly; it is a divine, not a human, activity. 

Then there is \( *śl* . 4a\) the “supreme-nonsupreme worship” \( *parāparāpūjā* \). It consists in “seeing all that appears of itself” and especially, it seems, all rites as being in truth of a purely spiritual nature. 

### aparapūjā
The description of the nonsupreme \( *aparapūjā* \), ritually performed worship begins next. It fills *śl.* 8–199. It conforms to the usual pattern of the Tantric worship, whose dual \(if somewhat contradictory\) aim is to [[18]] identify the performer with the deity while worshipping her. It includes the following items: 

- Four succeeding series of ritual placings \( *nyāsa* \) of mantras, of deities, and of the *śrīcakra* on the body of the officiating adept\( *śl.* 8–89\). 
- The construction of the throne \( *āsana* \) of the Goddess and the offering of a propitiatory oblation \(a *bali* \) to the Yoginīs \( *śl.* 90\). This is where an “inner sacrifice” \( *antar-yāga* \), or “worship of the self \( *ātma-pūjā* \), should normally take place, but the YH does not mention it.
- Removal of obstacles \( *vighnabheda* \) \( *śl* . 92–93\).
- Worship of the sun \( *sūryapūjā* \). This is a preliminary rite of all Śaiva cults, with the sun being worshipped as an aspect of Śiva \( *śl.* 94–95\).
- Drawing of the *śrīcakra* on which the ritual worship is to be performed \( *śl.* 95–97\). 
- Offering of the “common *arghya*” —consecrated water and so on—on a special diagram; worship of the *āsana* and *pīṭha* and of the *kalās* of fire, sun, and moon \( *śl.* 98–100\). 
- Preparation of the “special *arghya* ” \( *viṣeśārghya* \), which, as appears later on, includes wine, and offering it to Bhairava and to the succession of masters \( *gurupaṅkti* \) \( *śl.* 103–104\). 
- Inner oblation \( *homa* \) in the “fire of desire” \( *kāmāgni* \). This is normally performed materially at the end of the ritual. Here it is an interiorized, mystical oblation \( *śl.* 105–108\). 
- *Śrīcakrapūjā* , worship of the Goddess and of her retinue of deities \( *āvaraṇadevatā* \) with sixteen erings or services \( *upacāra* \), on each of the different parts of the *śrīcakra* , from the outer square to the center \( *śl.* 109–161\). This is the main part of the *pūjā* . It ends with the offering of the “lamp of Kula” \( *kūladīpa* \), together with wine and pieces of meat \( *śl.* 165–168\). 
- *Japa* of the *śrīvidyā* \( *śl.* 169–188\). 
- “Satisfaction” \( *tarpaṇa* \) of the deities of the *cakra* with erings of wine, meat, and fish \( *śl.* 190\). 
- Occasional \( *naimittika* \) rituals to be performed on certain days to the Yoginīs of the *śrīcakra* \( *śl ̥ .* 191–197\). 
- Taking in by the officiant of the leftovers of the offerings to the deity and final *bali* to Baṭuka and Kṣetrapāla. 

[[19]]

The last stanzas \(199–204\) deal with the fruits, worldly or otherworldly, resulting from the performance of the *pūjā* . 

All of these rites will be explained and discussed later, with the translation of chapter 3. The following, however, may be said now about some of them. 

#### Nyāsa 

Eighty-one stanzas, nearly one-fifth of the chapter, are taken up by the prescription of this long and complex ritual, which is indeed important since it infuses the body of the officiating adept with the powers of the Goddess, identifying him with her. 


First, six different “forms” \( *rūpa* \)— we could say epiphanies, divine and cosmic—of the Goddess are placed. This ritual placing \(or imposition\) being sixfold, it is called *ṣoḍhā-nyāsa* . It is considered particularly important and efficacious. It is prescribed and extolled in many of the texts, ancient or modern, of the Tripurā/Śrīvidyā tradition. It is also mentioned in other Śaiva traditions. [^38] 

[^38]: It is mentioned by Abhinavagupta in the *Tantrāloka* and in Tantras of the Kubjikāmata.

Next \( *śl.* 41–68\) comes the *nyāsa* of the *śrīcakra* ,  
first of its nine concentric parts,  
then of the deities abiding in those parts,  
going from the outer square, imposed on the extremities of the body,  
to the Goddess, imposed on the heart.  

This is followed by another placing \(the third series of *nyāsas* \) of these deities, starting with the Goddess and ending with the Siddhis of the outer square. These two rites will increase the feeling of identification of the officiant with the Goddess by an interiorization of her diagrammatic cosmic form. The YH says \( *śl.* 81\) that he is now to consider himself as inseparable from her \( *svābhedena cintayet* \). 

Then, as a fourth series of *nyāsas* \( *śl.* 81–86\), come eight different placings of various entities on the hands and on other parts of the body. 

The *nyāsas* end with a libation \( *saṁtarpaṇa* \) to the Goddess, which is, in fact, a meditative practice with an ascent of *kuṇḍalinī* ; this somehow confirms the ritual identification of the adept with the deity he worships. 

### Śrīcakrapūjā 

This is not a worship of the *śrīcakra* but a worship, performed on the *cakra* , of Tripurasundarī, who resides in its center while also pervading it, and of all the deities of her retinue placed in concentric tiers around her in the different parts of the diagram. They are worshipped going from the outer [[20]] square to the inner triangle, the Goddess herself being worshipped in the whole *śrīcakra* since it is her diagrammatic cosmic form. 

We have already enumerated the different parts of this *pūjā* . We note here, however, that in each of the constituent parts of the *śrīcakra* , a Siddhi is worshipped, which is both a deity and a supernatural, magical power. Thus, the worship in each of the *cakras* confers on the *sādhaka* one of the eight main magical powers, the *mahāsiddhis* , *aṇimā* , and so on. [^39] 

[^39]: There are traditionally eight main *siddhis* always quoted, beginning with *aṇimā* , the power to become as small as an atom \( *aṇu* \). The others are *laghimā* , to be light; *mahimā* , being large; *prāpti* , to obtain all; *prākāmya* , being irresistible; *īśitva* , domination; *vaśitva* , subjugation; and *yatra-kāmāvasayitā* , to be able to go to whatever place one wishes. A ninth *siddhi* , *garimā* , to become heavy, is sometimes added.

The ritual worship, therefore, is not only a means to approach the Goddess and identify with her but also a means to acquire supernatural powers, as is expressly stated in *śl* . 189 and 203 of the chapter. This is in conformity with the Tantric conception of liberation in this life, which confers worldly powers along with liberation. 

The *pūjā* is made up of a number of sometimes complex rites organized as a dynamic, coherent ritual process, with two intermediate meditative periods, carrying the worshipper from the outer, ordinary world to the realm of the gods, a process during which he acts out symbolically an inner transformation from his condition of a mere mortal being to that of *jīvanmukti* by identification with the godhead. 

Progressing along this structured ritual and spiritual path, the officiating adept, after “entering” the diagram by paying homage to the lower and most external deities abiding in the outer square, the *bhūgṛha* ;  
purifies his hands and his *prāṇa* \(in the two lotuses\);  
then causes his *kuṇḍalinī* to ascend and feels thus absorbed into the cosmic energy \(the *kulaśakti* \), which is also present in his body, this in the *cakra* of fourteen triangles.  
As he concentrates on an inner subtle phonic resonance \( *nāda* \), he raises his *kuṇḍalinī* again from the *mūlādhāra* to the *ājñācakra* \(in the first *cakra* of ten angles\), and then, along with the *kuṇḍalinī* \(in the second ten-angles *cakra* \), he becomes absorbed in his own essence.  
After that, as his *prāṇa* is concentrated in his heart \( *cakra* of eight triangles\), he realizes the pure essence of consciousness,  
and \(having attained the central triangle\) he worships the higher deities destructive of the cosmos surrounding the Goddess, which means that he rises to the source of the universe.  

The worship having now reached the central *bindu* “whose nature is that of the supreme *brahman* ,” the adept worships Tripurasundarī in the whole *śrīcakra* since she pervades it. This he does “in total freedom,” that is, with the absolute liberty of one who has outsoared \(ritually, of course\) all limitations. 

Perceived in this way, as a movement from this world to the supreme deity, the *pūjā* is for the adept not a random succession of discrete ritual actions but a total and fulfilling existential experience of participation in [[21]] the divine, a coherent progress toward the Absolute realized by an identification with the cosmic play of the Goddess. 

### Japa 

Finally comes the *japa* , the recitation of the *śrīvidyā* , the *mūlamantra* of the Goddess, a rite performed in the last part of all ritual Hindu worships. 

The *japa* prescribed here is, however, not really a recitation. It is a complex spiritual and yogic exercise associating the enunciation \( *uccāra* \) of the *vidyā* with visualizations and with the ascent of *kuṇḍalinī* . The *uccāra* is, in fact, an upward movement of the phonic resonance of the *śrīvidyā* along the *suṣumnā* , going from the *mūlādhāra* up to the *dvādaśānta* , [^40] inseparable from the ascent of the *kuṇḍalinī* . 

[^40]: On this center of the yogic body, situated twelve finger-breadths above the head, see chapter 3.49.

It is therefore a practice of Tantric mantrayoga where the *śrīvidyā* is used as a means to facilitate the fusion of the adept with the cosmic divine power of the Goddess. 

The *japa* is made up of four meditative-yogic practices: 

#### Three parts of the śrīvidyā 
*Japa* of the three parts of the *śrīvidyā* \( *śl.* 169–173\).

- This consists in visualizing the three parts and the nine constituent *cakras* of the *śrīcakra* as tiered along the *suṣumnā* , 
- then to perceive the *kalās* of the subtle vibration of the *bīja HRĪṂ* , which ends these three parts \( *kūṭa* \) of the mantra as ascending from the *mūlādhāra* to the heart, then from the heart to the *ājñācakra* and thence up to the *dvādaśānta* , where the threefold phonic vibration reaches the plane of *unmanā* , the “transmental,” and dissolves into the silence of the Absolute, with which the adept also fuses. Table 3.1 in chapter 3 shows the pattern of this *japa* . 

#### śūnyaṣaṭkam
*Japa* of the sixfold void, *śūnyaṣaṭkam* \( *śl.* 174–175\). This practice involves only the *uccāra* of the three *HRĪṂ* and their *kalās* , the *uccāra* being organized along six “voids,” or points of the yogic body. It does not seem to include visualizations. Like the first one, it leads to a fusion with the Absolute “in the central void of the divine undivided Consciousness,” says the Dī. 


#### Avasthās
*Japa* of the five states of consciousness, the *avasthās: jāgrat* , waking; *svapna* , dream; *suṣupti* , dreamless sleep; *turya* , the “fourth” state; and *turyātīta* , “above the fourth” \( *śl.* 176–180\). It is also an *uccāra* of the *śrīvidyā* with which the adept experiences these states, from the ordinary waking state up to the highest, “above the fourth,” which is identical with the absolute divine Consciousness. 

[[22]]

#### viṣuvas
*Japa* of seven “equalizations,” *viṣuvas* \( *śl.* 181–193\). This is the longest practice, since it includes seven *japas* . It is also the most difficult to understand, since the nature of these *viṣuvas* —apparently states of equilibrium of the *prāṇas* —does not appear clearly. It is also a meditative practice whose aim, as with the preceding ones, is to bring about a fusion of the adept with the Absolute. It is a somatopsy-chic—bodily, mental, and spiritual—practice; in the Tantric domain, whatever is experienced spiritually is also “lived” in the body. 

### Last offerings
Finally, the third chapter describes the last offerings of the *pūjā* . 

### siddhi
It ends, too \( *śl.* 188–189\), by promising the adept who has performed all of these deifying rites or practices \(and who is, we may believe, on the way to liberation\) not liberation, *jīvanmukti* , but that he will rapidly be in possession of all possible supernatural powers. This may strike us as something of an anticlimax. But on the one hand, is this ritual worship meant to lead progressively, by its daily practice, toward liberation, or is it not rather an acting out of such liberating experiences? 

Be that as it may, the fact is that the *śrīcakrapūjā* , being performed repeatedly every day, cannot but create mental impregnations \( *vāsanas* \) which can eventually bring the performer, if not to liberation, at least to its threshold. This salvific efficacy can act progressively with the repeated performance of the *pūjā* , whereas the magical powers are “rapidly” obtained; both can therefore be given by the same ritual. 

On the other hand, in the Tantric perspective, liberation and powers are inseparably linked: a *jīvanmukta* may despise supernatural powers, consider them as fetters, but he is necessarily endowed with them. We may recall here the Śivasūtras, or Abhinavagupta stating that whatever the *jīvanmukta* says is mantra and that all of his actions are *mudrās* ; these are supernatural actions resulting from the condition of liberation in life. 

The Tantric perfection is metaphysically not of this world, but it takes place in it. It is not disincarnate. It is total plenitude \( *pūrṇa* \). It is experienced, “lived,” on all planes of being. The liberated person is free from the fetters and illusions of this world: he or she outsoars it but also dominates it. The quest of a magical domination of the world is, as much as the hope for liberation, an Indian dream.
