Cakrasaṁketa 

The *yoginī-hr̥daya* begins with the Goddess asking her consort, Bhairava, to enlighten her on the secret teachings of the Vāmakeśvaratantra—by which is meant either the text of this name or a larger textual ensemble of the Tripurā/Śrīvidyā tradition \(see introduction, above\). This dialogue being carried out between two deities is viewed as taking place out of time, in the Absolute. 

On the complex meaning of the term *saṁketa* , which cannot be satisfactorily translated by one word and which we try to render here both by encounter \(or co-presence\) and by agreement, see the introduction, above. 

It is this commonly agreed presence of Śiva/Bhairava and the Goddess in the *śrīcakra* that transforms it in the \(visible\) embodiment of the diff erent aspects of the cosmic creative and reabsorbing power of the Goddess united with Bhairava. It gives its powers and efficacy to the *śrīvidyā* and ensures the soteriological efficacy of the *pūjā* . 

The Goddess said:

*śrīdevyuvāca* 

O God of gods, great God, expanding in total fullness, there are in this Vāmakeśvatatantra many unknown elements //1// please reveal them entirely, O Bhairava\! 

*devadeva mahādeva paripūrṇaprathāmaya* /

*tāṁstān arthān aśeṣeṇa vaktum arhasi bhairava* /

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

Bhairava said:

*śrībhairava uvāca* 

Hear, O Goddess, the great secret, the Heart of the Yoginī, supreme. 

//2// What I tell you now out of love for you is to be kept carefully hidden. On earth, it has \[always\] been taught and received by word of mouth. //3// It must not be given to the disciples of other \[masters\], nor to unbelievers, O Goddess\! nor to those who do not wish intensely to hear it, or who do not give over riches. //4// 

*śṛṇu devi mahāguhyaṁ yoginīhr̥dayaṁ param* //2// 

*tvatprītyā kathayāmy adya gopitavyaṁ viśeṣata ḥ* / 

*karṇāt karṇopadeśena saṁprāptam avanītalam* //3// 

*na deyaṁ paraśiṣyebhyo ṇāstikebhyo na ceśvari* / 

*na śuśrūṣālasānāṁ ca naivānarthapradāyinām* //4// 

It can be given to \[someone\] who has been examined and tested 

during half a year. As soon as one knows it, O Woman with beautiful hips\! one attains the state of *khecara* . //5// 

*parīkṣitāya dātavyaṁ vatsarārdhoṣitāya ca* / 

*etajjñātvā varārohe sadya ḥ khecaratāṁ vrajet* //5// 

Secrecy is always insisted upon in Tantric traditions, which are initiatory. 

The teaching is therefore transmitted secretly by the master, the guru, to a carefully chosen disciple, intent on acquiring the esoteric knowledge of the tradition, fully devoted to his master and careful not to divulge the doctrine to unbelievers. The mention of those who give over riches may well surprise us, but it was traditionally considered one of the ways to gain knowledge—

or at least a means to approach a master. 1 More generally, as is often said in ritual texts, to spend lavishly on costly rituals is meritorious or even a religious duty: one must never be stingy in one’s relationship with the deity. 

We must not forget that in India, poverty is not meritorious; it is an imperfection, a stigma, the result of the play of karma, therefore not unmerited. 

As for *khecaratā,* it is a supernatural power \(a *siddhi* \) consisting in being able to move \( *caratā* \) freely in space \( *khe* \) but, more specifi cally, to move—that is, to fuse spiritually—in the inner space or sky, the heart, the central void \( *kha* \) of consciousness. The Sanskrit term *kha* means a hole, an opening, and, more technically, the void for the axle in the hub of a wheel, a notion metaphysically transposed to mean the “void” \( *śūnya* \), 

26
which is the “central” inner essence of the deity: one who moves \( *cara* \) in that void is identifi ed with Śiva. The state of *khecaratā* is thus the highest spiritual attainment: liberation. 

The teaching as expounded by Bhairava now begins:

O Supreme Goddess\! Threefold is the agreed co-presence of the 

goddess Tripurā: the agreement 2 concerning the *cakra* , and those concerning the mantra and the worship. //6// 

*cakrasaṁketako mantrapūjāsaṁketakau tathā* / 

*trividhas tripuradevyā ḥ saṁketa ḥ parameśvari* //6// 

As stated in the introduction above, the adept must realize and experience ritually and mystically the divine co-presence of the two aspects, male and female, of the supreme deity during the practices and observances prescribed in the three chapters of the YH, their spiritual effi cacy resulting 

from this active, dynamic co-presence. 

The fi rst chapter will now describe this divine presence and power as found and understood in the *śrīcakra* :

As long as one does not know this threefold agreement, one will not be recipient of the supreme authority \[inherent\] in the *cakra* of Tripurā. //7// 

*yāvad etan na jānāti saṁketatrayam uttamam* / 

*na tāvat tripurācakre paramājñādharo bhavet //7//* 

The YH now describes the agreement concerning the *cakra* , that is to say, both the diagrammatic structure of the *cakra* with the deities who reside there and the understanding the disciple must have of this *cakra* as embodying the cosmic manifestation of the power of the Goddess united with Śiva. 

This \[ *cakra* 

includes\] fi ve energies directed toward emanation\( *srṣṭyā\)* , and four fi res turned toward resorption \( *layena\)* . The *cakra* is \[therefore\] produced by the conjunction of fi ve energies and four fi res. //8// 

*tacchaktipañcakaṁ sṛṣṭyā layenāgnicatuṣṭayam /* 

*pañcaśakticaturvahnisaṁyogāc cakrasambhava ḥ* //8// 

The concentric series of triangles that make up the *śrīcakra* result from the intersections of fi ve triangles apex downward: 3 the energies or powers 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

27

\( *śakti* \), the female aspect of the godhead, and four triangles apex upward: the so-called fi res, the male aspect. The energies \( *śakti* \) are creative. The cosmos appears through their play. Fire, on the contrary, evokes destruction, resorption. The total cosmic play of the Goddess, who creates and dissolves the universe, is thus implicitly present in the very pattern of the *śrīcakra.* 

I will tell you, O Perfect One, the descent \[on earth\] of your *cakra* . 

*etac cakrāvatāraṁ tu kathayāmi tavānaghe* / 

The *śrīcakra* being the diagrammatic form of the Goddess is a divine, transcendent reality. It therefore comes down to earth \(a process known as *avatāra* \) so as to be perceived and worshipped by the adepts or devotees. 

This happens because the Goddess wills it:

When She, the Supreme Power, \[becoming\] out of her own free will embodied as all that exists \( *viśvarūpiṇī* \), perceives herself as fl ashing forth, the *cakra* then appears. //9// 

*yadā sā paramā śakti ḥ svecchayā viśvarūpiṇī /* /9// 

*sphurattām ātmana ḥ paśyet tadā cakrasya saṁbhava ḥ* / 

The *śrīcakra* being the cosmic form of the Goddess results from the same act of consciousness or awareness \( *vimarśa* \) of the deity as the cosmos. As Amṛtānanda says in the Dī , “The intensely luminous fl ashing forth of the Supreme Power is nothing else than the emission of the cosmos.” The apparition of the *śrīcakra* is therefore described in *ślokas* 10–17 

in terms of a cosmic process that simultaneously manifests the geometric pattern of the *śrīcakra* and brings about the apparition of the deities that abide in the *cakra* and animate, nay manifest it, by their power. This is why the process is described starting from the center, that is, from the Goddess. 

Note that each of the nine constituting parts of the *śrīcakra* is called *cakra.* \(See fi gures 1.1 and 1.2.\) 

From the void letter *A* and from that which ends by emission, \[that is\] from the *bindu* , vibrating consciousness whose supreme nature is light and which is united with the fl ashing flow \[of divine power, appears\] the throne of the *bindu* \( *baindavāsana* \) which is the \[birth\]

place of the flow made up of the three *mātṛkās* . It then assumes a threefold aspect. // 10cd–12a //

“The void letter *A* ” \( *śūnyākāra* \) is to be understood as the supreme Śiva, and since Śiva precedes creation, it is considered as void. *A* , the fi rst letter of the Sanskrit alphabet, is traditionally considered the origin and substrate of the whole alphabet, which, in the Śaiva system of phonetic emanation, is the source and essence of the cosmos. Hence the identifi cation of *A* with the supreme deity.

**figures 1.1 and 1.2 **\(Continued\) 

The *bindu* , the *anusvāra* , the nasal addition to the preceding vowel \( *A* , in this case\), written as a dot over the letter it prolongs, is conceived of as the fusion of Śiva and Śakti into one point of concentrated energy: the notion is both visual \(a dot\) and metaphysical. *Bindu* is thus metaphysically both the totality of the Absolute and the power that will manifest the universe. Being a concentrate of creative power, *bindu* is always described as luminous and vibrating, throbbing. 

The “flow of the three *mātṛkās* ” issuing from it are \(says the Dī \) the three levels of the Word: *paśyantī, madhyamā* , and *vaikharī* , 4 which is another way of saying that the central *bindu* is the birthplace of the whole cosmos, while underlining the fact that the levels of the cosmos appear together with those of the Word and with the letters of the Sanskrit 

30
alphabet, which, as we shall see, are in eff ect associated with the diff erent parts of the *śrīcakra* . 

The triangle surrounding the *bindu* is said to have a threefold aspect insofar as the two triangles \(one of energy, one of fi re, therefore one female, one male\) are added to the central one, which makes three times three. 

This is why the triangular *cakra* surounding the *bindu* is called *navayoni* , ninefold womb. This *navayonicakra* is associated with, or rather brings about the apparition of, nine elements, as follows:

\[Thus appear\] *dharma* and *adharma* , then the \[ four\] *ātman* , 5 the knower, what is to be known and knowledge: the *cakra* is thus a ninefold womb. It is immense, a compact mass of consciousness 

and bliss. A division of mantras in nine \[corresponds to\] this ninefold *cakra* . //12–13// 

*dharmādharmau tathātmanau mātṛmeyau tathā pramā* //12// 

*navayonyātmakam idaṁ cidānandaghanaṁ mahat* / 

*cakraṁ navātmakam idaṁ navadhā bhinnamantrakam* //13// 

*Dharma* 6 is the socioreligious Hindu law, *adharma* its opposite, for there is no rule without its contrary. The four *ātmans* —a notion developed notably in Vedānta—correspond to four levels of the Self as consciousness, from the Absolute to the living being. Together with the knowing subject, objectivity, and knowledge, they make up the whole cosmic manifestation. This is why this *cakra* is considered the womb—the ninefold womb \( *navayoni* \)—of the universe. This *cakra* is said to include nine mantras, those of the of the regent-goddesses \( *cakreśvarī* \) 7 of the nine parts \( *cakras* \) of the *śrīcakra* . 



The three categories—knower \( 

*pramātṛ*\), object of knowledge\( *prameya* \), and means of knowledge \( *pramā* or *pramāṇa* \) 8 —are deemed to recapitulate the totality of the world as experienced by the subject who 

“knows,” perceives what is to be known: the objectivity and who does this using means or criteria of knowledge. It is a very common philosophical notion, which we will meet several times here. 

\[This ninefold *cakra* \] is present in the \[next *cakra* \], of eight triangles, in the form of Ambikā, surrounded by vowels, it is the dynamism of consciousness, 9 the fi re of resorption rising from the throne of the *bindu* . //14//

*baindavāsanasaṁrūḍhasaṁvartānalacitkalam* / 

*ambikārūpam evedaṁ aṣṭārasthaṁ svarāvṛtam* //14// 

The *cakra* of eight triangles results from the expansion of the *navayoni* , says the Dī. This is why the *navayoni* is said to be present in it as Ambikā, the Mother, the Goddess, who dominates and brings together the three fi rst energy-goddesses, Vāmā, Jyeṣṭhā, and Raudrī, and who is to be imagined as encircled by the fi fteen “vowels,” from *A* to *bindu* , the sixteenth one, *visarga* , remaining inside. 

The two next *cakras* are made up of ten triangles:

The \[fi rst of the two *cakra* \] of ten triangles is a shining form born from the fl ashing forth of the nine triangles. It causes the luminosity of the ten phonemes, from the one preceding *śakti* 10 to the last of the nine \[ following ones\]. //15// It is the support of the light of the ten subtle and gross elements. The fl ashing form of the second ten-pointed \[ *cakra* is associated with the ten\] phonemes beginning with *krodhīśa.* //15–16// 

*navatrikoṇasphuritaprabhārūpadaśārakam* / 

*śaktyādinavaparyantadaśārṇasphūrtikārakam* //15// 

*bhūtatanmātradaśakaprakāśālambanatvata ḥ* / 

*dvidaśarasphuradrūpaṁ krodhīśādidaśārṇakam* //16// 

The nine triangles are the eight of the *navayoni* together with the so-called *baindavāsana* , the throne of \(or the throne that is\) the *bindu* . 

In each of the ten triangles of this *cakra* is a phoneme, beginning with *YA* \(which, in the Sanskrit alphabet, precedes *RA* \) and going up to the last phoneme, *KṣA* . 11 The light \( *prakāśa* \)—the essence, that is—of the ten gross and subtle elements \( *bhūta* and *tanmātra* \) abides also in these ten triangles. The ten phonemes “beginning with *krodhīśa* ” are the fi ve guttural and the fi ve palatal phonemes, from *KA* to *ÑA* \( *krodhīśa* 12 being a name for *KA* \); they are associated with the objects of the senses and the organs of action \(speech, etc.\). 

The transformation of the luminescence of the \[fi rst\] four *cakra* s conjoined \[with the *cakra* of ten angles\] results in the fourteen-angled one whose nature is that of sense perception and of the sense organs. \[The next *cakra* \] is made up of the expansion, in the highest sense, of the 

32
phonemes from *khecarī* to *jayā* , its nature being therefore that of the luminescence of Raudrīfl ashing forth as fi re and energy. //17–18// 

*catuścakraprabhārūpasaṁyuktapariṇāmata ḥ* / 

*caturdaśārarūpeṇa saṁvittikaraṇātmanā* //17// 

*khecaryādijāyantārṇaparamarthaprathāmayam* / 

*evaṁ śaktyanalākārasphuradraudrīprabhāmayam* //18// 

The *cakra* of fourteen triangles is associated with sense perception \( *saṁvitti* \) and the fi ve senses of apperception and the fi ve of action, to which are added mind \( *manas* \), “egoity” \( *ahaṁkāra* \), and intellect \( *buddhi* \) 13 , to these—so as to have a total of fourteen—is added a fourth element, which, according to the Dī , is *citta* , the limited empirical consciousness. 

\[Then appear\] the square, a form of Jyeṣṭhā, and the threefold circle, a form of Vāmā. //19a// 

*jyeṣṭhārūpacatuṣkoṇaṁ vāmārūpabhramitrayam* / 

The square is the outer quadrangular part of the *śrīcakra* , sometimes called *bhugṛha* , the house of the earth, since it is the part of the diagram deemed to be metaphysically on the level of the earth. The “threefold circle” refers to the two eight- and sixteen-petal lotuses with the three circular lines that enfold them. 

Another vision of the nature of the *śrīcakra* , as associated with the fi vefold cosmic division of the *kalās* , is now propounded: The inner triangle participates in consciousness \( *cit* \). The eight triangles, of *śāntyātīta* \[ *kalā* \]. //19// The two ten-pointed \[ *cakras* \] as well as the fourteen-pointed one are part of *śānti* \[ *kalā* \]. \[The one that\] is surrounded by eight petals is made up of the eff ulgence of the *vidyākalā* . //20// The sixteen-petaled lotus shining clearly is in the body of the *pratiṣṭhā* \[ *kalā* \]. When the aspect of the *nivṛtti* \[ *kalā* \] 

shines forth, the square shines. //21//

One of the divisions of the cosmos of the Tantric traditions is that of the *kalās* . It is part of an all-embracing cosmic and soteriological conception that divides the ways of apparition and maintenance of the cosmos \(and the ways toward liberation\) into “six paths” \(or ways, *adhvans* \): the *ṣ aḍadhvan* . It is a sixfold division into two groups of three notions or entities, all spreading from the deity to our world, to create and animate the cosmos, and manifest ways also to be followed, going upward, toward liberation. 

These *adhvans* are: the way of time \( *kālādhvan* \), which includes the phonemes, the mantras, and the “words,” entities that exist in time, not materially; and the way of space \( *deśādhvan* \), which includes the *kalās* , the *tattvas* , and the *bhuvanas* , which are more concrete elements, existing in space. The *bhuvanas* are the infernal, terrestrial, and divine 

“worlds,” numbering usually 224. The *tattvas* are the thirty-six entities or cosmic levels, from Śiva to the earth. The *kalās* , “portions,” are divisions too complex to be described here. They include *tattvas* and *bhuvanas* in addition to phonemes, mantras, and “words” \( *padas* \). The highest *kalā* is *śāntyātīta* , “transcending *śānti,”* made up of Śiva and Śakti; then comes *śānti* , made up of the next three *tattvas* ; then *vidyā* , made up of the *tattvas* from *puruṣa* to *māyā* ; then *pratiṣṭhā* , from *prakṛti* to water; and fi nally, *nivṛtti* , earth. 

The correspondences between the parts of the *śrīcakra* and the fi ve *kalās* are logical since they both give expression to the same cosmic hierarchy, going from the deity to our world: the creative and animat-ing process of emanation, embodied diagrammatically by the pattern of the *śrīcakra* , which *is* the Goddess, as creating and embodying the cosmos. 

An opposite movement is shown in *ślokas* 22–24, the parts of the *śrīcakra* , with their attending deities, being enumerated in the reverse order, from the outer square to the center, according, that is, to the process of resorption \( *saṁhārakrameṇa* \), a process that goes metaphysically from the level of this world to the plane of the supreme deity and is also symbolically present in the *śrīcakra* . The nine parts are quoted not by their names but by the divine entities or deities abiding in them. These are divided in three groups:

In the nine *cakras* , Trailokyamohana and so forth, O Sureśvarī\! are found *nāda* , *bindu* , *kalā* , Jyeṣṭhā, Raudrīthen Vāmā, //22// as well 

34
as Viṣagnī, Dūtarī, and Sarvānandā, in this order. *Nāda* and *bindu* are undivided, Kālī has the nature of will, //23// Jyeṣṭhā is knowledge, the remaining ones being activity. The *cakra* is thus threefold. 

It is a form of *kāmakalā* ; its essential nature is expansion. //24// 

*trailokyamohanādye tu navacakre sureśvari* / 

*nādo bindu ḥ kalā jyeṣṭhā raudrīvāmā tatha ḥ puna ḥ* //22// 

*viṣagni dūtarīcaiva sarvānandā kramāt sthitā ḥ* / 

*niraṁśau nādabindū ca kalā cecchāsvarūpakam* //23// 

*jyeṣṭhā jñānaṁ kriyā śeṣam ity evaṁ tritayātmakam* / 

*cakraṁ kāmakalārūpaṁ prasāraparamārthata ḥ* //24// 

The Dī explains the triplicity of the *śrīcakra* mentioned in these three stanzas as linked to three forms of energy-goddesses, each being present in a group of three *cakras* . Thus, the peaceful, *śāntā* , which is consciousness \( *cit* \), is indivisibly present in the outer square and in the sixteen-petal lotus, with *nāda* and *bindu.* The eight-petal lotus is made of the energy of will \( *icchā* \). Jyeṣṭhā is the energy of knowledge \( *jñāna* \) and is present in the fourteen-triangle *cakra* . The remaining fi ve *cakras* \(the two ten triangles, *navayoni* , central triangle, and *bindu* \), in which are located the goddesses Raudrī, Vāmā, Viṣagnī, Dūtarī, and Sarvānandā, are pervaded by the energy of activity \( *kriyā* \). The *śrīcakra* is thus pervaded by the three basic energies of Śiva, their places in it being inverted, since the highest, *śāntā* , is in the outer square and the lowest in the center, an inversion that expresses the omnipresence of the whole energy of Śiva in the whole diagram. 

To say that the *śrīcakra* is a form of *kāmakalā* is to say that it is a form of the \(sexual\) union—and therefore both embodying and causing the expansion/emanation of the cosmos—of Śiva and Śakti expressed by the *kāmakalā* . 14 

Yet another manner of conceiving and making a yogic and meditative use of the *śrīcakra* is expounded in the following eleven *ślokas* \(25–35\): In *akula* , in what is called *viṣu* , in energy and in fi re, then in \[the *cakra* of \] the navel, in the *anāhata* , the \[ *vi* \] *ṣ uddha* , the uvula, the forehead, //25// in the moon and the half \[moon\], in *rodhinī* , *nāda* , *nādānta* , and *śakti* , then in *vyāpikā* and in the domain of *samanā *

and *unmanā* , //26// then in the *mahābindu* , one must meditate in this way the \[ *śri* \] *cakra* in a threefold manner. 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

35

Up to the *ājñā* \[ *cakra* , the meditation\] is said to be with parts \( *sakala* \), then up to *unmanā* it is with and without parts \( *sakalaniṣkala* \). 

On the supreme level, it is without parts \( *niṣkala* \). It is \[therefore\] 

threefold. 

On the forehead \[the *kalā* \] is round, like a lamp; \[the enunciation, 

there, lasts\] a half a mora. 15 //28// *Ardhacandra* \[located above it\] has the same aspect and lasts one fourth of a mora. *Rodhinī* , appearing like moonlight is triangular in shape; it lasts an eighth of a mora. 

//29// \[ *Nāda* , to be visualized as\] a line between two dots, is shaped like a penis, scintillating like a jewel, lasts a sixteenth of a mora. 

//30// Lasting half as long is *nādānta* fl ashing like lightning, in the shape of a plow, with a *bindu* on its right. Then *śakti* like an upright line above and to the left of two *bindus* . //31// *Vyāpikā* appears when *bindu* , by its play, becomes triangular. *Samāna* , then, is a straight line between two *bindus* . *Unmanā* \[appears\] when the play of *bindu* 

produces a straight line. 16 

The essential body 17 of *śakti* , etc., shines like twelve blazing suns. 

//33// The fractions of mora of the \[enunciation\] from *śakti* onward are 1 / of a *mora* , then two times less, then again half as much for 64

*manonmanī* . Then \[comes\] *unmanī* . //34// 

Higher still, \[there is\] the Supremely Great, transcending the limitations of time or space, of innate beauty, overflowing with supreme bliss. //35//

The YH prescribes here to meditate, that is, to visualize each of the nine constituent parts of the *ṣ rīcakra* in each of nine bodily *cakras* \(also called *padma* , lotus\) tiered along the *suṣumnā* , from its lowest part to the *mahābindu* , a system of *cakras* proper to this text \(see fi gure 1.3\). 

As the Dī explains, these *cakras* are the following: at the base, at the root of the *suṣumnā* , is the *akulapadma* , a red thousand-petal lotus, turned upward, above which is another, eight-petal lotus supporting a third, six-petal lotus. These three elements form what is called *viṣu* , a word that means poison but is taken to come from the Sanskrit root *VIŚ* , to enter or be present, this lotus being deemed to pervade in essence all thirty lotuses tiered along the *suṣumnā* . What these thirty lotuses are is not explained by the Dī , but the YH probably refers to secondary subtle centers \( *ādhāra* , *sthāna* , etc.\), which we will meet later. Above these lotuses are the usual seven *cakras* : *mūlādhāra* \(“fi re”\); *svādhisthāna* , considered as the place of *śakti* ; *maṇipūra* ; *anāhata* ; *viṣuddha* ; *lambika* \(on the uvula\); *ājñā* \(or *bhrūmadhya* \), above which the yogin is to meditate on the *bindu* . On the top of the head is another thousand-petal lotus, on the *brahmarandhra* . All this is usual. 

But now the *bhāvanā* takes on a diff erent aspect, since the adept is to 

“meditate” the *kalās* , the subtle phonic “parts” of the *bīja HRĪṂ* starting with the *bindu* \(the *anusvāra Ṃ* , that is, which prolongs the *M* of *HRĪṂ* \) and ending with *unmanā* . He is to cause to appear in his mind \( *bhāvayet* \) all these *kalās* , seeing them mentally as described in *ślokas* 27–34. The Dī 

explains that in this meditation, the conventional shapes and colors of the *kalās* , along with the aspect of the deities abiding in the nine bodily centers, are to be visualized.

The adept should do this while giving to each of these mental images the prescribed length of time. These, however, are so infi nitesimal as to be entirely theoretical. We may therefore surmise that they are meant merely to express the extreme subtlety and transcendence of these phonic elements. 

When this supreme *kalā* sees the fl ashing forth of the Self, assuming the aspect of Ambikā, the supreme Word is being uttered. //36// 

*ā* *tmana ḥ sphuraṇaṁ paśyed yadā sā paramā kalā* / 

*ambikārūpam apannā parā vāk samudīritā* //36// 

When the supreme Goddess perceives herself as identical with the supreme Śiva—that is, when the supreme godhead, in total plenitude, at once male and female, becomes conscious of this state—she becomes 

38
Ambikā, the Mother, the origin, in other words, of all that is. She is then also the supreme Word \( *parā vāk* \), which is the basic ground and substrate of the universe, and the absolutely peaceful, Śāntā, energy deity. 

This metaphysical level is to be imagined diagrammatically as in the center of the *śrīcakra* . 

The creative function of the levels of the Word is then shown as visibly embodied in the geometrical structure of the inner triangle of the *śrīcakra* : When she turns toward \[creation\] so as to manifest the universe 

which is held \[within her\] as a seed, taking on the form of a hook, 18 

\[she becomes\] Vāmā because she vomits the universe. //37// Then, being the energy of will, this very \[goddess\] embodies herself as the visionary \[word\]. Then, as energy of knowledge, she is Jyeṣṭhā, and the intermediate word is being enunciated. //38// With the conservation of the universe, her form spreads out as a straight line. Then, on the level of resorption, she takes on the form of *bindu* . //39// 

When the reverse process takes place, she fl ashes forth in a body 

\[shaped like\] a *śṛṇgāṭa* . She is then energy of action. She is Raudrī, the corporeal \[word\], appearing as the universe. //40// 

*bījabhāvasthitaṁ viṣvaṁ sphu ṭīkartuṁ yadonmukhī* / 

*vāmā viśvasya vamanād aṅkuśākāratām gatā* //37//

*pratyāvṛttikrameṇaivaṁ śṛṅgāṭavapur ujjvalā* / 

*kriyāśaktis tu raudrīyaṁ vaikharīviśvavigrahā* //40// 

These four *ślokas* describe the process whereby the Goddess, having perceived herself as the supreme \(divine\) limiting creative power \( *paramakalā* \), manifests the universe through the three stages or levels of the Word \( *vāk* \), starting out from *paravāk* , the supreme Word, which is the eternal, omnipresent, pervasive ground of the whole process. This process, in the metaphysics of nondualist shaivism, brings about the cosmic manifestation as resulting from the Word: the world exists because it has been and is eternally being enunciated, expressed by the supreme deity, which is essentially Word. 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

39

There are, based on *parā* , three stages or levels in this process. First is the visionary \( *paśyantī* \) word, in which there appears in the divine consciousness a vision of what will be manifested—the word and the vision being inextri-cably mixed. Then comes the plane of *madhyamā* , the intermediate word, in which there appears a diff erentiation between elements of word or speech and in which the lineaments of the objective world appear but still ideally. 

There is a third and lower plane of the word, that of *vaikharī* , the “corporeal,” 19 in which words and objects appear manifested and separately. 20 

But in the present case, what appears after the intermediate word is not the next stage of manifestation but the opposite movement: toward resorption, with the *bindu* , the dot in the center of the central triangle. This is because the whole process takes place within the deity and because creation and destruction are always present together in the supreme godhead. 

This process, which unfolds on the highest divine plane, is thus described as resulting from the Goddess assuming the aspect of four goddesses and of four energies. First is Ambikā, the Mother of creation, together with the highest peaceful \( *śāntā* \) goddess form of energy, on the plane of *parā vāk.* Then comes *vāmā* , “because she vomits the universe”\( *viśvasya vāmanāt* \), projects it outside, that is, together with the energy of will \( *icchā* \). She also visualizes ideally the universe in herself, the level of the word being *paśyantī* . After this comes the goddess Jyeṣṭhā, together with the power of knowledge \( *jñānaśakti* \), since she takes cog-nizance of her creation on this plane. It is the level of *madhyamā vāk* . 

Since the creative movement stops here and a reverse, resorption movement appears, the Goddess takes on now the form of the fearsome Raudrī, deemed to arise together with the divine power of action \( *kriyāśakti* \), described as abiding in the central *bindu* wherein all powers are united and concentrated. The central triangle is thus complete, its three sides being made by the forms taken on by Ambikā, Vāmā, and Jyeṣṭhā, with Raudrīon *bindu* in the center. 

What the adept is to realize here is the fi rst creative movement of the supreme Goddess manifesting the inner triangle of the *śrīcakra* together with the four basic forms of energy and four forms of herself as four energy-goddesses, while retaining all this within herself: hence the fourth goddess, Raudrī, and the return to the *bindu* . 

In or around this central triangle, other entities are now to appear: While manifesting 21 everything that exists in essence then exter-

nally, these four energies \[produce\] KA PŪ JĀ O, in that order. //41// 

40
These *pīṭhās* are located respectively in the bulb, the word, the form, and beyond all form. Their forms are respectively those of a square, a circle with six *bindus* , a half-moon, and a triangle. They are known as being yellow, smoke-gray, white, and red. //42–43// 

*bhāsanād viśvarūpasya svarūpe bāhyato ‘pi ca* / 

*etāś catasra ḥ śaktyas tu kā pū jā o iti kramāt* //41// 

*pīṭhā ḥ kande pade rūpe rūpātīte kramāt sthitā ḥ* / 

*caturasraṁ tathā binduṣaṭkayuktaṁ ca vṛttakam* //42// 

*ardhacandraṁ trikoṇaṁ ca rūpāṇy eṣāṁ krameṇa tu* / 

*pīto dhumras tathā śveto rakto rūpam ca kīrtitam* //43// 

The four basic energies, from *śāntā* to *kriyā* , present in the central triangle around the Goddess are now said to bring about the apparition of more concrete cosmic elements, the *pīṭhas* , which are the four main seats or centers of presence and power of the Goddess. They are quoted by the initials of their names, which are Kāmarūpa, Pūrṇagiri, Jālandhara, and Oḍḍiyāna, four places ensuring “geographically” the concrete presence of the Goddess in the Indian subcontinent. 22 A characteristic of Tantric sacred geography is that it is mentally and bodily interiorized, so the *pīṭhas* are also to be visualized by the adept on four points of his yogic imaginary body. The bulb \( *kanda* in Sanskrit\) is a bulge in the lower part of the *suṣumnā* usually considered as the center from which issue and radiate in the body the 72,000 *nā ḍīs* , the channels in which the *prāṇa* circulates. It is also assimilated to the lower yogic center, the *mūlādhāra* . 

The three terms “word” \( *pada* \), “form” \( *rūpa* \), and “beyond the form”\( *rūpātīta* \)—together, usually, with *piṇḍa* rather than *kaṇḍa* —are the names of four centers of the yogic body. According to the Dī , “word” refers to the *haṁsa* , which we may understand here as the inner breath in the heart. The 

“form” \( *rūpa* \) would be the *bindu* , on the forehead, on the so-called *ājñā *

center. “Beyond the form” \( *rūpātīta* \) refers to the *brahmarandhra* . The *pīṭhas* appear thus as tiered along the *kuṇḍalinī* , where they are to be visualized as colored geometrical shapes, which are, in fact, those of the *maṇḍalas* of four elements, the *tattvas* of earth, water, fi re, and air. Their being associated with *cakras* of the yogic body, from the base to the summit of the *kuṇḍalinī* , corre-lates cosmic and human levels. This practice \(since the *pīṭhas* are to be visualized and “interiorized”\) is thus at once mental-spiritual, diagrammatic-visual, bodily \(in the yogic sense\), and cosmic, the description of this part of the 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

41

*śrīcakra* being at the same time the prescription of a yogic practice. This is one more instance of the tantric association of ritual and yoga. 

Now *liṅgas* are described as present in the same places: The self-existing *liṅga* , the *bāṇaliṅga* and the *itara* , then the supreme 

\[one\], O Dear One, are present in the *pīṭhas* . //44// 



They shine like gold, \[like\] the bandhūka flower, the autumn 

moon. The great *svayambhuliṅga* is surrounded by the vowels and is three-pronged. //45// The *bāṇaliṅga* , triangular, is encircled by the phonemes from *KA* to *TA* . \[The *itara* \] is shaped like the round flower of the Kadamba and is encircled by the letters from *THA* to *SA* . //46// The supreme *liṅga* is subtle; it is enclosed by all the phonemes. It is the *bindu* , root of supreme bliss, arising from the eternal plane. //47// 

*svayambhūr bāṇaliṅgaṁ ca itaraṁ ca paraṁ puna ḥ* / 

*pīṭheṣvetāni liṅgāni saṁsthitāni varānane* //44// 

*hemabandhūkakusumaśaraccandranibhāni tu* / 

*svarāvṛtaṁ trikūṭaṁ ca mahāliṅgaṁ svayambhuvam* //45// 

*kāditāntākṣaravṛtaṁ bāṇaliṅgaṁ trikoṇakam* / 

*kadambagolakākāraṁ thādisāntākṣarāvṛtam* //46// 

*sūkṣmarūpaṁ samastārṇavṛtaṁ paramaliṅgakam* / 

*bindurūpaṁ parānandakandaṁ nityapadoditam* //47// 

The *sādhaka* is to imagine these *liṅgas* as being on the same places as the *pīṭhas* : three on the three angles of the inner triangle, the fourth on the *bindu* in the center. Since *liṅgas* are icons of Śiva, we may assume that to conceive them as placed on the *pīṭhas* , the seats of the Goddess, is to mark symbolically the co-presence \(the *saṁketa* \), the union, of these two, male and female, aspects of the supreme deity. 23 

A *liṅga* is an icon of Śiva of any aspect, shape, or material, not necessarily the more or less visibly phallic image one usually means when using the term. 24 *Liṅgas* are classifi ed in Tantras or in iconography manuals under diff erent names and categories, notably that of “special” \( *śiṣṭ a* \) *liṅgas* , which is the case of those mentioned here, where their shape and color are specifi ed for the adept to visualize them. 

The self-existing \( *svayambhu* \) *liṅga* is normally any sort of natural object that has been declared to be a visible icon of Śiva. In the present 

42
case, it is described as three-pronged \(that is, says the Dī , having three *bindus* on its summit\) and golden in color. *Bāṇalingas* , as a rule, consist mostly of quartz and are egg-shaped pebbles. Here it is triangular and red. The *itaralingas* , as their names indicate \( *itara* means “other”\), are normally all other sorts of *liṅgas* . Here it is said to be round like a ball and white. The *paraliṅga* is colorless, invisible, since it is above the fi eld of the senses. It is, says the Dī , “the root made of bliss of the liana extending from *A* to *KṣA* whose boughs are the \[levels of the Word\] *paśyantī* , 25 etc., and whose imperishable root is the supreme \( *parā* \) word. It ‘arises from the eternal plane’ because the *mātṛkā* is eternal. This *liṅga* arises as the primordial vibration \( *prathamaspanda* \) 26 from the eternal plane which is to be reached by all those who wish to be liberated from the fetters of this world.” 

Here, too, the phonemes of the Sanskrit alphabet are present but in their subtle form, as the *mātṛkā* , the “mother” of the phonemes, not as utterable phonic elements. The vowels are associated with the *svayambhuliṅga* since they are of a higher nature than the consonants, associated with the *bāṇa* and *itara liṅgas* , whereas the whole alphabet, the totality of the power of the Word, is associated with the supreme *liṅga* . 

Such are the *kula* and *kaula* entities expressed by the whole mantra taken as a whole with its three *bījas* . //48// 

Such \[too\] are the states called waking, dream, deep sleep, and fourth, as well as the one beyond, supreme splendor \[wherein\] 

appears the consciousness of the Self. //49// 

*bījatritayayuktasya sakalasya mano ḥ puna ḥ* / 

*etāni vācyarūpāṇi kulakaulamayāni tu* //48// 

*jāgratsvapnasuṣuptākhyaturyarūpāṇy amūni tu* / 

*atītaṁ tu paraṁ tejas svasaṁvidudayātmakam* //49// 

Having associated the four *liṅgas* with the *mātṛkā* and with the levels of *parā, paśyantī* , and so on, that is, with the total power of the Word, the YH now considers these entities to be expressed or predicated \( *vācya* \), that is, brought to existence by—or to have their essence in—the three parts, here called *bījas* , of the *śrīvidyā* and \(for the supreme *liṅga* \) by or in the *ṣ rīvidyā* taken in its totality. The term *kula* is understood by the Dī as referring to the three human and cosmic divisions: knower, object of knowledge, and knowledge—or subject, objectivity and cognition; or measurer, 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

43

measurable, and criteria of measurement—\( *pramātṛ-prameya-pramāṇa* , which we have already seen above, *śl* . 12–13\), taken separately, *kaula* referring to these three elements taken together. 27 

Then \( *śl.* 49\) another, human group of four elements is added as present in the center of the *śrīcakra* : the four *avasthas* , which are states or modalities of consciousness going from the ordinary waking consciousness \( *jāgrat* \) to a fourth \( *turya/turīya* \) subtle one, these four being sub-sumed and dominated by a fi fth “above the fourth” \( *turyātīta* \) transcendent state, identical with the supreme uncreated divine Consciousness. 28 

What comes forth appearing as a self-willed visible layout of everything in the shape of the universe is Consciousness, a form of the Self, beauty of uncreated bliss. //50// 

*svecchāviṣmayollekhakhacitaṁ viśvarūpakam* / 

*caitanyam ātmano rūpaṁ nisargānandasundaram* //50// 

Having shown the goddesses or energies present in or around the central triangle as issuing from the absolute while having it as their essence and substrate, the YH now comes back to the cosmic aspect of the *śrīcakra* : by drawing it out by an act of her own will \( *svecchā* \) as a visible layout of everything that exists \( *viśvamayollekhakhacita* \) consisting in the universe \( *viśvarūpaka* \), the Goddess manifests the universe as the *śrīcakra* , entirely pervaded by her power. The Dī quotes here Kṣemarāja’s *Pratyabhijñāhr̥daya* , 29 2: “By the power of her own will she unfolds the universe on her own screen” \( *svabhittau* \), that is, on herself as the essence and substrate of all. The Dī also quotes a well-known formula:: “The Lord Śiva gladdens having seen the infi nite diversity of the world which he has drawn out with the brush of his own will.” Another quote: “the supreme energy inseparable from Śiva has as her body the whole cosmic process.” 

That the diagrammatic and the cosmic processes are one and the same is again stated, as follows:

When the measurable, the measurer, and the criteria of measure 

spread out, the brightness contracts, being will, knowledge, and activity. \[Consciousness then\] takes on a triangular 30 form. //51// 

*meyamātṛpramāṇamānaprasarai ḥ saṁkucatprabham* / 

*śṛṇgāṭarūpam āpannam icchājñānakriyātmakam* //51// 

44
What appears now in the supreme Consciousness is the condition of the knower \( *pramātṛ*\), the empirical subject \(the measurer\), and what the subject can know \(the objects, which are measurable, *meya* \), knowledge \( *pramā* \), and its criteria \( *pramāṇa* \). This development implies a “contraction” \( *saṁkoca* \) of Consciousness since it evolves from an absolute fullness and undiff erentiation to the diff erentiated, discursive thought \( *vikalpa* \) of the empirical, individual subject, an evolution whose dimension here is cosmic: the divine energy takes on the form of the universe without, however, losing her divine, absolute, luminous nature. This is expressed by saying that she acts as the three fundamental divine powers of will, cognition, and activity \( *icchā, jñāna* , and *kriyā* \). These being three, she becomes threefold, a condition expressed in the YH by saying that she assumes the shape of a water chestnut \( *śṛṅgāṭa* \). 

The YH now says \( *śl* . 52–55\) how the adept is to conceive meditatively—

by *bhāvanā* —and visualize the supreme deity as abiding in the *śrīcakra* :

\[One must see the energy of consciousness as\] the resting place of the very nature of Śiva as the sustaining power of the expansion of the forms of the universe, supremely beautiful, resting as on a couch against the hip of Kāmeśvara. //52// Shining, she holds the noose made of the energy of will, the hook which is \[energy of \] 

knowledge, the bow and the arrows made of energy of action. //53// 

Split into support and supported, divided into eight, bearer of weapons, arising from the *cakra* with eight points, she has the ninefold *cakra* as a throne. //54// 

*viśvākāraprathādhāranijarūpaśivāśrayam* / 

*kāmeśvarāṅkaparyaṅkaniviṣṭ am atisundaram* //52// 

*icchāśaktimayaṁ pāśam aṅkuśaṁ jñānarūpiṇam* / 

*kriyāśaktimaye bāṇadhanuṣī dadhadujjvalam* //53// 

*āśrayāśrayibhedena aṣṭ adhā binnahetimat* / 

*aṣṭ āracakrasaṁrūḍhaṁ navacakrāsanasthitam* //54// 

The supreme energy of the godhead, supreme consciousness, is now to be conceived as the metaphysical resting place of Śiva, who supports the expansion of the cosmos. She is also to be visualized as the goddess Kāmeśvarīresting on the lap of the god Kāmeśvara: 31 a division in two of the absolute oneness of the supreme which will bring about the multiplicity 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

45

of the expansion \(through the thirty-six *tattvas* \) of the cosmos. This divine pair is described as each bearing the four symbolical “weapons” \( *āyudha* , here called *heti* \) of Tripurasundarī, each identifi ed with one of the four 32 

basic energies of Śiva, and is therefore said to be divided into eight. 

Although arising from the *bindu* , in the center of the inner triangle, this pair, which is somehow the Goddess herself, stretches out in the whole *śrīcakra* , which is ninefold, and is thus her throne. 

This is the form in which the supreme splendor abides embodied 33 

as the 

*śrīcakra* 

, surrounded by the sparkling waves of her 

multitudinous energies. //55// 

*evaṁrūpaṁ paraṁ teja ḥ śrīcakravapuṣā sthitam* / 

*tadīyaśaktinikarasphuradūrmisamāvṛtam* //55// 

The supreme splendor is the supreme godhead, Tripurasundarī, in her cosmic aspect as the *śrīcakra* , with all the deities that animate it surrounding her. The image is that of a central throbbing core of light and power surrounded, as by the waves of the sea, by the energies emanating from this center. 

More technically, but interestingly, the Dī explains as follows this flow of the divine energies as linked to, or embodied as, the *śrīcakra:* “When Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī, who are pure light and refl ective awareness \[ *prakāśavimarśamaya* \] 34 assume by their own free will the forms of the constitutive parts of the *śrīcakra* , then the energies which constitute these parts surround them in the form of the *āvaraṇadevatās* Kāmeśvarī, Vajreśvarī, Bhagamālinī\(etc.\).” 

As for the word “wave” \( *ūrmi* \), it is explained as follows: “the supreme Lord, who is light \[ *prakāśa* \] is the sea, Kāmeśvari, which is awareness \[ *vimarśa* \] 

is the water, the waves being the numberless energies into which they divide themselves. As the waves appear and subside in the sea, so the *cakra* made of the thirty-six *tattvas* , with its energies, appears and disappears there.” 

Having visualized in this way the *śrīcakra* in its dynamic cosmic aspect, the adept is now to visualize and experience bodily and mentally, while displaying them, nine divinized powers, the *mudrās* , which are deemed to reside in the *cakra* \( *śl* . 56–71\):

When Consciousness becomes luminously aware of the universe 

\[appearing\] on the screen of her Self, fi lled with the desire for 

46
action, she \[produces it\] by her own free will. //56// \[She is then\] 

energy of activity, called *mudrā* because she gladdens the universe and makes it flow. 

*cidātmabhittau viśvasya prakāśāmarśane yadā* / 

*karoti svecchayā pūrṇavicikīrṣāsamanvitā* //56// 

*kriyaśaktis tu viśvasya modanād drāvaṇāt tathā* / 

*mudrākhyā* 

The awareness that the Goddess, supreme consciousness, has of the universe born from her is said to be luminous since the cosmic manifestation has just been described as an ocean of light. In nondualist Tantric Śaiva traditions, the apparition of the cosmos is viewed as a real transformation of the deity into the universe: she is “made of everything \[that exists\]” \( *viśvamaya* \). The world, therefore, is not purely illusory. 35 The creation is also viewed as an image the godhead projects as with a ray of light on herself, as on a screen, which is to say that she is not only the origin but also the substrate of the world. Since the world is being manifested, the energy acting in this case is the energy of activity \( *kriyāśakti* \). 

The interpretation of the term *mudrā* as gladdening \( *modana* , from the verbal root *MUD* , therefore *mu* \) and causing to flow \( *dravayati* , from the root *DRU* , to flow or dissolve, therefore *drā* \) is traditional. 36 The term can thus be taken as denoting the blissful flow of the universe, diff erent aspects of which will be shown as appearing in diff erent parts of the *śrīcakra* \(which is a cosmic diagram\), as a result of the action of such secondary deities as the Mudrās, who embody diff erent aspects or stages of the cosmic activity of the Goddess. They are described in the YH as energy-goddesses, not as hand gestures, the usual meaning of *mudrā* . 

Only in the Dī \(and in Bhāskarāya’s commentary\) are they shown as gestures \(and as deities or energies\). These hand gestures are to be displayed by the adept, who will thus not only evoke the *mudrās* as deities but also, through this physical action, experiment in mind and body the cosmic activity of the Goddess as she manifests the cosmos, or, in this case, reabsorbs it, a process parallel to that of the quest for liberation. 

When this consciousness, Ambikā, made of three *kalās* , //57// 

becomes divided into three, she causes the continuous presence 

\[of the Goddess in the *śrīcakra.* \]. She is celebrated as pervading the whole *cakra* . //58//

47

*trikhaṇḍārūpam āpannā saṁnidhikāriṇī* / 

*sarvasya cakrarājasya vyāpikā parikīrtitā* //58// 

Consciousness \( *saṁvit* \) is said to be made of three *kalās* , since *kalā* s are limiting forms of power \(see above, *śl.* 21, and n. 10\). The term denotes the three energy-goddesses Vāmā, Jyeṣṭ hā, and Raudrī, who, taken together, are Ambikā, the Mother of all powers, the Goddess, who, 

“becoming divided into three,” is present as these three goddesses in the whole *śrīcakra* but also as the *mudrās* . As such, she “causes her continuous presence” \( *saṁnidhi* \) in it, since, in Hindu ritual, a deity is to be actually, continuously, and favorably present in the icon when it is to be worshipped. 

*Saṁnidhi* , or *saṁnidhāna* , is the third of a series of four ritual actions to be performed at the beginning of all worship to ensure this divine pres-

ence. 37 The Goddess is, of course, always present in and as the *śrīcakra* . 

The *saṁnidhi* here is to ensure her presence as *mudrās* who symbolize nine diff erent aspects of her cosmic activity.

*vāmāśaktipradhāneyaṁ dvāracakre sthitā bhavet* //59// 

The Mudrās, 38 as divine aspects of the cosmic activity of the Goddess, are now enumerated, going from the outer square section of the *śrīcakra* to its center. The fi rst aspect of this activity to be considered is that of creation, in the outer square \( *bhūg ṛha* , house of the earth\), which corresponds, in the cosmic symbolism of the *śrīcakra* , to the plane of the manifested world. The *mudrā* Sarvasaṁkṣobhinī, the universal agitator, disturbs the cosmos, that is, embodies the action of the Goddess as actively present in this world, not purely quiescent and transcendent. 

In Śaiva nondualist systems, the term *kṣobha* , which, like *saṁghaṭṭa* , has sexual connotations, implies creation. As the D 

ī says, 

*sṛṣtir *

*eva k *

*ṣ obha ḥ* 

, “agitation is indeed creation” \(or “creation is indeed 

agitation”\). 39 

The quadrangular external part of the *śrīcakra* is called *cakra* of the doors \( 

*dvāracakra*\), because each of its four sides includes a portion

technically called a door \( *dvāra* \), by which the offi

ciating adept can enter or 

leave 40 the diagram. Being considered on the level of the empirical world, 

of *māyā* , this *cakra* is fi ttingly called Trailokyamohana \(“delusion of the three worlds”\), since the Goddess deludes, enchants, the world by upholding its deceiving nature through her *māyā* . 

The goddess Vāmā is so called, it is said, because she “vomits” \( *vamati* \), that is, brings out, manifests, the world. 

The YH mentions only the metaphysical aspect of the *mudrās* , their role as divine energies. They are, however, also hand gestures, to be displayed by the adept. This is explained in the Dī for each of the ten *mudrās* . 

These explanations are interesting, but translating these passages would take too much space here. Sketches of these hand poses, made by a *paṇḍit* of the French Institute of Indology in Pondicherry, are given in fi gures 1.4 

and 1.5. 

When Jyeṣṭ hā predominates, she ensures the conservation of the universe 

\[which had been\] agitated. As the *kalās* of the gross aspect of the phonic subtle vibration, she bestows grace to all. //60// This 

selfsame Mudrā whose form fl ashes forth is in the *cakra* called Sarvāśapūraṇa. 

*kṣubdhaviṣvasthitikarījyeṣṭ hāprācuryam āśritā* / 

*sthūlanādakalārūpā sarvānugrahakāriṇī* //60// 

*sarvāśāpūraṇākhye tu saiṣā sphuritavigrahā* / 

After the creative agitation caused by Vāmā, the energy-goddess Jyeṣṭ hā 

now causes the preservation \( *sthiti* \) of the universe. This action is considered to take place \(diagrammatically\) on the level of the sixteen-petal lotus called Sarvāśapūraṇa \(“fulfi llment of all wishes”\). The *kalās* mentioned here are the sixteen “vowels,” from *A* to *visarga* , in their gross, that is, 

audible, form. 41 

According to the Dī , these *kalās* are also sixteen “attracting” divine energies, Kāmākarṣinīand so on, which are to be worshipped in this *cakra* during the *pūjā* . 42 

The Dī gives the name of this Mudrā: Sarvavidrāviṇī \(“causing everything to flow”\) and, naturally, describes the corresponding hand gesture. 

“Because its nature is conservation,” it says, “it consists in raising the 

50
joined middle and index fi ngers and joining the ring and little fi ngers. Its nature being to attract desires, it causes fullness of divine grace.” 

When Jyeṣṭ hā and Vāmā are in equilibrium, creation predominates. 

//61// This Ākarṣiṇī *mudrā* is known as the agitator of the universe. 

*jyeṣṭ hāvāmāsamatvenaṣṛṣṭ e ḥ prādhānyam āśritā* //61// 

*ākarṣiṇī tu mudreyaṁ sarvasaṁkṣobhiṇī smṛtā* / 

The role of this *mudrā* does not seem to diff er greatly from that of the preceding one, whose action it seems merely to confi rm. Interestingly, the Dī says that if this *mudrā* is attracting \( *ākarṣiṇī* \), it is “because of the curved position \(like a hook\) of the two index fi ngers”; the gesture is given as explaining a metaphysical element. This is one more case of the total interpenetration of the theoretical and the bodily, characteristic of the *mudrās* . 

This *mudrā* 

is localized in the lotus of eight petals called 

Sarvasaṁkṣobhanacakra, the *cakra*  of universal agitation. 43 

\[The *mudrā* \] who holds herself in the interval between two *vyomans* , O Maheśvarī\! //62// is known as causing the absorption into the deity resulting from the conjunction of Śiva and Śakti. It is an embodiment of the bliss of consciousness, located in the *cakra* of fourteen triangles. //63// 

*vyomadvayāntarālasthabindurūpā maheśvari* //62// 

*śivāśaktyākhyasaṁśleṣād divyāveśakarīsmṛtā* / 

*caturdaśāracakrasthā saṁvidānandavigrahā* //63// 

The term *vyoman* , which means sky, space, or ether, refers here to secondary centers of the yogic body sometimes also called *śūnya* , void. They are described as numbering fi ve, tiered along the *suṣumnā* , where they are located between the bodily *cakras* , from *mūlādhāra* to *ājñā* . The Dī adds that between these elements there are also fi ve other secondary centers, 44 

*bindus* , to be identifi ed with the gross elements \(the *mahābhūtas* \). 

The absorption \( *āveśa* \) in the union of Śiva and Śakti embodied in this *mudrā* , called Sarvāveśakarī, is displayed in the corresponding hand gesture, which consists in a joining of the hands, the fi ngers being inter-locked. It embodies the bliss of consciousness \( *saṁvidānanda* \), since the fusion \( *saṁśleśa* \) of Śiva and Śakti is intensely blissful. 

* *

*Encounter in the* Cakra* *

51

The *cakra* of fourteen triangles where this *mudrā* is to be contemplated is called Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka \(“giver of total happiness”\). 

When she fl ashes forth between the *bindus* as a subtle fl ame, the energy Jye 

ṣṭhā predominating, she intoxicates all beings. She 

remains, staying in the \[external\] *cakra* of ten triangles, O Praised by the heroes\! //64–65a// 

*bindvantarālavilasatsūkṣmarūpaśikhāmayī* / 

*jyeṣṭ hāśaktipradhānā tu sarvonmādanakāriṇī * //64// 

*daśāracakrāsthāyā saṁsthitā vīravandite* / 

This *mudrā* , looking like a fl ashing fl ame, extends, according to the Dī , from a *yonibindu* placed in the *mūlādhāra* to a *mahābindu* , on the level of the *brahmarandhra* , therefore along the *suṣumnā* , which means that the experience of the adept is one of *kuṇḍalinīyoga* , not a merely mental, visual one. What with the visual evocation of the *mudrā* in the yogic body as part of a practice of *kuṇḍalinī* yoga, conjoined with the display of the corresponding hand gesture, this practice appears as a particularly complex mental-bodily experience. 

The *mudrā* ’s name is Sarvonmadinī\(“totally intoxicating”\). The *cakra* of ten triangles is called Sarvārthasādhaka \(“accomplisher of all \[human\] 

aims”\). 

Then the energy Vāmā predominating \[again\], she becomes the 

Great Hook. //65// Thus, vomiting the universe, she abides in 

the second \[ *cakra* \] of ten triangles, being full of joy, remaining in the form of *mudrā* . //66// 

*vāmaśaktipradhānā tu mahāṅkuśamayīpuna ḥ * //65// 

*tadvad viśvaṁ vamantīsā dvitīye daśārake* / 

*saṁsthitā modanaparā mudrārūpam āsthitā * //66// 

The energy *-* goddess Vāmā is considered to permeate the second *cakra* of ten triangles, named Sarvarakṣākāra \(“bringing protection to all”\). As we saw previously \( *śl* . 37\), Vāmā \(the word means also left, crooked, oblique\) was associated with the left, oblique side of the inner triangle. Now she is similarly associated with the hook *mudrā* , her joy being the bliss of fusion with the supreme godhead. An *aṅkuśa* is a hook or goad of an elephant driver. It is one of the attributes \( *āyudha* , 45 “arms”\) held by Tripurasundarī. 

52
Born from the unifying interaction of *dharma* and *adharma* in the form of intelligence, she destroys the faults of omission in ritual action resulting from diff erentiated thought. //67// \[This *mudrā* ,\] 

the supreme *khecarī* , destroyer of the diseases born from diff erentiated thought, abides, made of consciousness, in the Sarvarogahāra *cakra* . //68// 

*dharmādharmasya saṁghaṭṭād utthitā vittirūpiṇi* / 

*vikalpotthakriyāloparūpadoṣavighātinī* //67// 

*vikalparūparoganāṇāṁ hāriṇī khecarīparā* / 

*sarvarogaharākhye tu cakre saṁvinmayīsthitā* //68// 

*Dharma* here means Śiva, and *adharma* is Śakti. That the *khecarīmudrā *



should be born from their conjunction, 

*saṁghaṭṭa*\(their total fusion, 

*sāmarasya* , says the Dī \), is not surprising, since this *mudrā* has a very high position in many *kula* traditions. It is the main *mudrā * described in the *Tantrāloka* \( chapter 32\), where it is described as a complex bodily-mental attitude deemed to bring about the presence of the deity and unite the adept with it. In the *Parātrīśikā* , a basic Trika work, the highest spiritual state the adept can reach is *khecaratā* , the state of being *khecara* , of moving \( *cara* \) in the void of consciousness \(  *khe* 46 \), a state described as the state of Śiva \( *śivāvasthā* \). In such a state, all forms of discursive, diff erentiated thought evidently disappear. 

Then, in the sky \[of consciousness\], in the fl ashing forth of the embrace of Śiva and Śakti, making the universe which is there in a subtle form to shine forth perpetually, //69// she holds herself in the Sarvasiddhimaya \[ *cakra* \] as the Great Mudrā whose nature is seed. 

Then, in this place where one enjoys the fullness of light, //70// this Yonimudrā which is the power to act, stays in the Sarvānandamaya 

\[ *cakra* \]. 

*śivaśaktisamāśleṣasphuradvyomāntare puna ḥ * / 

*prakāśayantīviśvaṁ sā sūkṣmarūpasthitaṁ sadā * //69//

*yonimudrā kalārūpā sarvānandamaye sthitā* / 

The luminous state of identifi cation with the union of Śiva and Śakti having been reached while displaying the *khecarīmudrā* , the adept, enjoying the bliss of the full luminousness of the divine consciousness, displays 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

53

the last *yonimudrā* , which evokes by hand gesture the *yoni* of the Goddess and also the Goddess as *yoni* , source or seed \( *bīja* \) of the universe. The Dī 

says that this *mudrā* embodies the dynamic power of the conscious awareness \( *vimarśakalā* \) of the supreme deity: the deity, in Tantra, is never static but is dynamic: bliss, absolute total consciousness, but also life, power, as is underlined in the next half-stanza. 

The *yoni* being always symbolized by a triangle, this *mudrā* abides therefore in the central triangle of the *śrīcakra* . 

The YH concludes:

This is how the \[energy of \] activity, whose nature is consciousness, abides in the \[ *śrī* \] *cakra* . //71// 

*kriyā caitanyarūpatvād evaṁ cakramayaṁ sthitam* //71// 

This half-stanza is commented on as follows by the Dī : “As has been said before \( *śl. * 57\), the power of activity is named *mudrā* because she gladdens the universe and makes it flow.” 

It is therefore only the energy of activity that, dividing herself, beauti-fi es and diversifi es herself by the division and the \(successive\) predominance of the energy-goddesses Vāmā and so on, and assuming the forms of the various *mudrās* , from Saṁkṣobhinīto Yoni, her nature being that of a consciousness \( *caitanya* \) that becomes the *cakra* , that is to say, that assumes the aspects of the ninefold 

*cakra* 

, from Trailokyamohana to 

Sarvānandamaya. To avoid, however, that one should believe that only the power of activity acts in the *śrīcakra* , the YH adds: The awakened must always meditate intensely on the supreme 

splendor which is will. //72a// 

*icchārūpaṁ paraṁ teja ḥ sarvadā bhāvayed budha ḥ * / 

The adept must never forget that it is the supreme deity, the united Śiva and Śakti, that acts through the energies of which *kriyāśakti, * that of activity, is the lowest. The YH reminds us, therefore, that the deity acts through her own free will, *svecchayā* . This the devotee must meditate in his heart, perceiving it directly, being however helped by his spiritual master, his guru \(who for him is Śiva\), and whose compassionate glance falls on him. This is called in Sanskrit *gurukatākṣapāta* , the descent of the glance \(bearer of the power of Śiva\) of the guru, who thus transmits the divine saving energy of the deity, sometimes called *śaktipāta* . 

54
Two other forms of “encounter” \( *saṁketa* \) with the *śrīcakra* —diff erent visions and practices of it, that is—are now described:

Now \[here\] are the threefold and the ninefold encounter of the 

*cakra* . //72b// 

*tridhā ca navadhā ca cakrasaṁketaka ḥ puna ḥ * //72// 

First the threefold division:

The fi rst \[section of the *cakra* is to be imagined as being produced\] 

by one fi re and two energies, the \[second\] one by three fi res and the triad of energies, //73// and the \[last\] as made up of two lotuses and the triple *bhūgṛha* . Five energies, four fi res, two lotuses, and the triple earths //74// \[constitute thus\] the great *cakra* in its complete fullness. 

This aspect \[of the *cakra* \] is explained \[thus\]: the fi rst \[portion\] is that of the *navayoni* . To this are added the two \[ *cakras* of\] ten triangles, //75// 

then the fourteen *yoni* and, immediately after, the third \[portion made up of eight and sixteen petals, followed by the triple square.\] //76// 

\[Thus\], O Parameśvarī, is described the threefold \[aspect of \] the *cakra* . The emanation, then, //77// goes from the *navayoni* to the earth and the resorption from the earth to the *navayoni* . Such is the teaching of the treatises. 

*vahninaikena śaktibhyāṁ dvābhyāṁ caiko ‘para ḥ puna ḥ * / 

*taiś ca vahnitrayenāpi śaktināṁ tritayeṇa ca* //73// 

*padmadvayena cānya ḥ syād bhūgṛhatritayena ca* / 

*pañcaśakti caturvahnipadmadvayamahītrayam* //74// 

*paripūrṇaṁ mahācakram tatprakāra ḥ pradarśyate* / 

*tatrādyaṁ navayoni syāt tena dvidaśasaṁyutam* //75// 

*manuyoni paraṁ vidyāt tṛtīyaṁ tadanantaram* / 

*aṣṭ advyaṣṭ adalopetaṁ caturasratrayānvitam* //76// 

*cakrasya triprakāratvaṁ kathitaṁ parameśvari* / 

*sṛṣṭ i ḥ syān navayonādipṛthivyantaṁ saṁhṛti ḥ puna ḥ * //77// 

*pṛthivyādinavayonyantam iti śāstrasya nirṇaya ḥ * / 

The *śrīcakra* is here conceived as made up of three portions. The fi rst one results from the interaction of one triangle apex upward \(the “fi re”\) 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

55

and two triangles apex downward \(the “energies”\), this constituting the eight-angle fi gure of the *navayoni* . The next portion is seen as adding to the preceding one two series of three triangles, one male \(“fi re”\), the other female \(“energies”\), which results in the two ten-triangle *cakras* and the fourteen-triangle one. The third portion is made up of the threefold circle and the square outer portion enclosed by three lines. 

The reason the *srīcakra* is to be conceived and meditated upon as made up of three section is—as the Dī explains—that each of these three threefold portions has a particular aspect \( *prakāra* \). In the central section, resorption \( *saṁhāra* \) predominates, and in the middle one, conservation \( *stithi* \) predominates, while manifestation \( *sṛṣṭ i* \) predominates in the outer portion. In addition, in each of these three *cakras* , *saṁhāra* , *sthiti* , and *sṛṣṭ i* are respectively considered as predominating. Thus, the dynamism of the *śrīcakra* taken as a whole is that of emanation when going from its center to its outward portion, that of resorption when going from the outer portion to the center. 

But since resorption, conservation, and emanation are all present in each of the three sections, the whole *śrīcakra* is, at the same time, entirely permeated by these three aspects of the cosmic activity of the Goddess, who is thus eternally and everywhere at once the creator, the maintainer, and the destroyer of the universe, a fact expressed by this three-times-threefold structure of her *cakra* . As the diagrammatic form of the Goddess, the *śrīcakra* thus symbolizes and expresses her ever living, throbbing, creative, and destructive power. To meditate and realize this mystically, as is here prescribed, is to realize and to fuse with this divine dynamic plenitude. Hence the usefulness of the *śrīcakra* , whose nine sections are now again enumerated and then named:

\[Now\], O Parameśvarī, is told in its entirety the *cakra* of Tripurā //78// 

through whose knowledge alone one becomes a knower of Tripurā. 



The division of the 

*cakra* 

into nine, I am telling you, O Dear 

One\! //79// 

There must fi rst be the threefold earth, 47 second the sixteen-petal 

\[lotus\], then the one with eight petals, then the fourteen triangles; fi fth comes the \[ *cakra* with\] ten angles and, sixth, the \[other of \] ten angles. In seventh position comes the \[ *cakra* of \] eight triangles, then, eighth, the central triangle, the ninth being in the center of 

\[this\] triangle. //80–82a//

The constituent *cakras* of the *śrīcakra* are enumerated going from its outer portion to its center: from this world, that is, to the supreme Goddess, which is the course of liberation. The Dī explains the names of the *cakras* and the rewards or power the adept is deemed to acquire when worshipping the Goddess and her retinue of ancillary deities and powers abiding in each *cakra* , as we shall see in chapter 3 below, where the diff erent parts of the *pūjā * are described. 

Trailokyamohana, “deceiving the three worlds”: the three worlds are to be understood as the ensemble formed by the objective world, the apprehension of this duality, and the subject, the “knower” who knows it and who is deceived by duality and discursive thought. 

Sarvāśāparipūraka, “satisfying all desires”: a satisfaction attained, says the Dī , when complete fusion with the supreme Śiva is attained. 

Sarvasaṁkṣobhana, “agitation of the universe”: interpreted as alluding to the movement \(s *aṁkṣobhana* \) through which the *tattvas* , from earth to Śiva, are reabsorbed into the supreme godhead. 

* *

*Encounter in the * Cakra * *

57

Sarvasaubhāgyadāyaka, “giver of all happiness”: the happiness is that of the union with supreme Śiva. 

Sārvārthasādhaka, “accomplisher of all \[human\] aims”: the highest of these aims is liberation \( *mokṣa* \) by union with the godhead. 

Sarvarakṣākāra, “eff ecting all protection”: putting away all obstacles to liberation. 

Sarvarogahara, “destroyer of all illnesses”: the illnesses are the manifested world, duality, all that is not liberation. 

Sarvasiddhimaya, “made of all accomplishments or powers”: these are the creation, maintaining, and reabsorption \( *sṛṣṭī* , *sthiti* , *saṁhāra* \) of the cosmos, of which the central triangle is diagrammatically the origin. 

Sarvānandamaya, “whose nature is all bliss”: this is the nature of the supreme godhead, the eternal union of Śiva and Śakti symbolized by the central *bindu* . 

Since the *śrīcakra* is not only the diagrammatic form of the Goddess but also the means to be used to worship her, the YH adds:



This is where must be worshipped the great Goddess 

Mahātripurasundarī. Such is, in its perfect fullness, the great *cakra* giver of eternal youth and immortality. //85 

*atra pūjyā mahādevīmahātripurasundarī* / 

*paripūrṇaṁ mahācakram ajarāmarakārakam* //85// 

One could be tempted here to note that the practice of the *śrīcakra* appears to be conferring immortality and not merely liberation, that is, a physical, worldly benefi t, not a purely spiritual one. The Dī , however, interprets this by saying that the one who has immortality and liberation is the supreme Śiva. Therefore, what is obtained by the worship of the *śrīcakra* is in eff ect acquiring the perfect and immortal state of Śiva, a point confi rmed by the last *śloka* . 

Thus has been said, O supreme Goddess\! the encounter with the 

great *cakra* of the goddess Tripurā, giver of liberation while still in life. //86// 

*evam eṣa mahācakrasaṁketa ḥ parameśvari* / 

*kathitas tripurādevyā jīvanmukti pravartaka ḥ * //86//
