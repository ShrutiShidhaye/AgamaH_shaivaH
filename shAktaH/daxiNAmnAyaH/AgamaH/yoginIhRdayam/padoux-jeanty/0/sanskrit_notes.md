Note on the Transcription and Pronunciation of Sanskrit

The sanskrit alphabet has forty-nine letters, which are transcribed in this book when necessary using diacritical signs according to a common international system. 

The vowels are pronounced very much like Spanish or French vowels. 

The short *a* , however, is pronounced like the *u* in “but,” and the long *ā is pronounced like the *a* in “fast.” 

As for the consonants, *g* is pronounced as in “guest,” *c* as *ch* in “church,” and *j* as in “jungle.” The aspirated consonants \( *tha, dha* , *pha* , *bha* \) are pronounced marking the aspiration, as in “top hat,” for instance. And *ṛ* is a vowel pronounced more or less like “ri.”
