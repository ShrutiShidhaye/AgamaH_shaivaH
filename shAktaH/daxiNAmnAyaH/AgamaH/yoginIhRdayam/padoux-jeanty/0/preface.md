This book originates in a French translation of the *Yoginī hṛdaya* from Sanskrit by André Padoux, published in 1994 in Paris by the Collège de France. It was printed by Editions de Boccard as an annotated translation with transliterated Sanskrit of the three chapters of the *Yoginīhr̥daya* and of its commentary by Amṛtānanda, meant for an academic readership. 

Pursuant to his interest in the ŚrīVidyā tradition, this book was read by Roger-Orphé Jeanty, living in the United States. Assuming that the *Yoginīhr̥daya* would be of considerable interest to a larger English-speaking readership, he proceeded in 2003 to translate its three chapters into English, working with his colleague Sarah Caldwell, using Padoux’s French translation and a Sanskrit *devanāgari* edition. This was published informally in English with the original Sanskrit both in the Indian *devanāgari* script and in transliteration. It was designed for use by readers interested in or practicing within contemporary Śrī Vidyā communities. 

Some time after completion, Jeanty sent a copy of this eff ort to Padoux, in recognition of the considerable eff ort required for the original published French version. In fact, Padoux had already considered the possibility of such a translation and began writing an English introduction to the text and attempted a translation of the fi rst chapter. But he found translating Sanskrit into English very difficult and the attempted translation very awkward and unsatisfactory, and he therefore abandoned it. 

Upon receiving a copy of this English translation, Padoux found it quite satisfactory, while admiring the beautiful *devanāgari* text that accompanied it. He thought it a pity that such useful work should be known and made use of by only a few people, and he suggested that they take up the job together. 

Padoux emended Jeanty’s translation when needed to make it more true to the original Sanskrit text, and Jeanty corrected Padoux’s English \(in the introduction and the notes and in the translation\) whenever necessary to make it more grammatically correct, more fluent, and conforming to American usage. 

It is sincerely hoped that this conjoined effort will make this important text much more widely known and distributed within an English-speaking readership.
