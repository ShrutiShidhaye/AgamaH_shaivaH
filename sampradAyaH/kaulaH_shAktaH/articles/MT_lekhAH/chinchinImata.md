## Origin
shrIkaNThanAtha under the great tamarind tree promulgated the three lodges via his three students, the rudrian incarnations of saMkarShaNa (oDIsha), skanda (ShaShThanAtha) & mitra (mitranAtha). The in the human realm the chi~nchiNImata was promulgated by 9 teachers from the 4 vs across bhAratavarSha. 

The first to receive the mantra was the trivedin trivikrama from pauNDravardhana who is said to have operated in oDDiyAna (some say sAmavedin, probably his primary veda). He routed the tAthAgata mantravAdin-s who attacked him in abhichAra contests.

As per the pashchimAMnAya, the great navAtman bhairava manifesting as the great tamarind tree emits shrIkaNThanAtha & chi~nchiNI for the promulgation of the chi~nchiNI-mata founded on the great 9-fold mantra.

One of the important yAga-s taught by the chi~nchiNI mata is that of the mantra known as the chalachakra whose devatA known as kaula umAmaheshvara is meditated upon as under the "world" tamarind tree in a grove of such trees. The umA here is said to be the shakti of the final deity mentioned in the vAmadeva-brahma-mantra & is also identified with a special version of the goddess of the pUrvAMnAya (trika). The meditation based on that realization is central to the siddhi of chalachakra.
