Interestingly, in Āgama sources, as I just recalled after writing this tweet 👇🏾, the 4 yugas are seen as characteristics of the Buddhi. Can we make something of this? 


One may advance a view that the yuga-based narratives in Itihāsapurāṇas are those of events which have occurred in non-physical Buddhitattva in a non-physical way, with some similarities to events as they have physically transpired on earth in what we call, “historical time”.

This may also explain why we can have contradictory accounts of key Itihāsa events & yet hold them all to be simultaneously true & divine accounts. It is because events in the Buddhi, unlike earth, is not limited to a single “stage of action” at any one point in time. What I mean is that on earth, at a particular place, at a specific point of time (the stage), only one version of an event could have physically happened. But this is not the case with the Buddhitattva, which possesses the capacity for infinite such “stages”.

Additionally, the often “hackneyed” explanation of kalpabheda for such contradictory accounts could be made more interesting by being made to cohere with the idea of yugas (& Kalpas?) being functions of Buddhitattva.

A Saiddhāntika Theology of History if you would have it ☝🏾
