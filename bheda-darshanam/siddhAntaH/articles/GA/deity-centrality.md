A common misconception many Hindus have about the Siddhānta, including many Śaiva-s but also others, is that the Siddhānta is centered on the supremacy of a "particular deity". Yes, Siddhānta upholds Śiva-paratvam but how to understand this?

In the Siddhánta, every Ātmā (sentient) is Cidghana (a pure mass of consciousness) whose inseparable Cicchakti consists of knowledge & power. These two are obscured by mala for all sentients except one, who is eternally unlimited & pure & beyond name & form. It is the case that the names & forms associated with that one, for the purposes of visualization & worship, happen to be the names & bodies actually possessed by deities we will call Śaiva or Raudra. In other words, though without any qualifiers, that One graciously allows us to qualify it with actual names & forms of certain beings, owing to their extraordinary purity. An elaboration of this point is given by Siddhānta-Pūrvācārya Śrī-Sarvātmaśaṃbhu. (Siddhānta-Prakāśikā of Sarvātma-śambhu.)

We call it Paramaśiva (together with inseparable Parāśakti), etc because our sages found it apt to describe this inseparable (like a thing & its essence) pair as male & female. Paramaśiva is a unique individual but remains eternally unqualified by any form, name or paraphernalia.

What you call Śaiva imagery & paraphernalia (a body, let alone even more specificities such as matted hair, poison in neck, serpents on body, trident, etc) - These are NOT essential to Paramaśiva/Parāśakti at all. So, what are they? They are concessions, to our needs, which are made possible through the existence of superior classes of beings (Mantreśvara-s & other Rudra-s) for whom these features are part & parcel of their subtle, non-physical but ultimately material (made of pure or impure Māyā). 

Post-script: The way a Siddhāntī will frame Śivaparatvam is different from how a Śaiva, without availing himself of the Siddhānta insight, will frame it, & different from how the exponents of other Devas’ paratvam will frame theirs. The relationship between the supreme entity of Siddhānta & the forms/paraphernalia attributed to “It” is far “looser” than this relationship as understood by Śaivas without the Siddhānta insight & looser than that in non-Śaiva systems. The visual, liturgical & ritual specificities peculiar to the Siddhānta are a result of the Supreme One’s All-Pervasive grace, which is received differently by different beings. Some classes of beings were so blessed that the Supreme One chose their names & the forms of their bodies & paraphernalia for Its devotees in their visualization & worship of It. 

Regarding 1, forgot to link here. Sigh.
ultimately material (made of pure or impure Māyā) *bodies.

One may argue that even in “non-sectarian” systems, the relationship between the Supreme One & the 5/6 forms is much “tighter” than that between the Supreme One & the Śaiva forms in Siddhānta. In other words, those 5/6 forms are far more fundamental/intrinsic to the nature of Brahman than what the Śaiva forms are to Paramaśiva.
