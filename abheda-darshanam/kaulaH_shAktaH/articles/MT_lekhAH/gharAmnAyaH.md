the kaula stream of shaiva tradition has four lodges or gharAMnAya-s founded by the successors of matsyendra-nAtha; they have 4 distinct bhairavI-s/bhairava-s:  

pUrvAMnAya=trika (shabdarAshi-bhairava& mAlinI or 3 trika devI-s/bhairavas;  
paschimAMnAya=kaubjikA (navAtman bhairava&kubjikA devI);  
uttarAMnAya=kAlI-kula (kAlI-s &bhairava-s like akulavIra);  
dakShiNAMnAya=shrI-kula(Anandabhairava/kAmeshvara & tripurA/kameshvarI)

later kaula traditions tried to position themselves as atop these 4 AMnAyas as UrdhvAMnAya;the kalI-kula UrdhvAMnAya presents this deity as guhyakAlI(posted yesterday)&shrIkula UrdhvAMnAya as tripurasundarI.

the advaita vedAntin-s tried to coopt both these schools: the former in mithilA & latter in south India
