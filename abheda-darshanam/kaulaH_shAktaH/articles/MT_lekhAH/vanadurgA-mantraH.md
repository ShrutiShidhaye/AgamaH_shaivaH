A rendering of vanadurgA, as an ectype of vindhyavAsinI. However, as the devatA vanadurgA, the origins of her tradition are rather enigmatic. Her mantra is given in inverted form in the tAntrika upaniShat known as vanadurgopaniShat. 

This text is structurally close to the mahAvidyA-stotra; however, the MVS does not specify the mantra of vandurgA. Nevertheless, it has a mantra to a female deity, the mahAvidyA, in likely corrupt form in the manuscripts/pubs I've seen, who is said to be parvate ... vanAntare rudrasya hR^idaye jAtA who is likely the same deity. 

The core vindhyavAsinI/vanadurgA mantra is unlike any other in terms of semantics, metricality (or deviation from such) or even intent  -- one could make a connection with kuNDalinI of the kaula tradition though the link is not obvious. We take it to be an archaic "mantra-fossil" that has been preserved in a rather uniform state across the Indosphere that was inherited intact from an early period of the tAntrika mantrashAstra. However, the connection to its original intent was likely lost or submerged and in need of more investigation.
