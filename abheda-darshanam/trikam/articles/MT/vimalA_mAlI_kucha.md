>  Kucha, or Kuchar in the local tongue is one of the principal oases located on the peripheries of the Tian Shan mountain range and the Takla Makan desert. Here, Lt. Bower was sold these manuscripts by a local man … Paleographic analysis and study of epigraphic and literary sources point to the fact that the bulk of the manuscripts fall within the range 350-375 AD while some segments in later parts would fall between 470-530 AD. …

> It runs as follows:— “ Oh thou pure, pure, stainless Devi! Oh Devi! That which is true, that which is well, all that do thou show to us. Though the human eye may fail, the divine eye will prevail; though the human ear may fail, the divine ear will prevail; (2) though the human smell may fail, the divine smell will prevail; though the human tongue may fail, the divine tongue will prevail. Oh thou Garlanded One, thou Garlanded One! Svaha”


The dice prognostication incantation to a goddess named vimalA & mAli, is IMO an important early attestation of the key pUrvAMnAya goddess who is central to that system as the one who takes the form of the garland of letters & the consort of the symmetric shabdarAshI bhairava

Her name adorns the title of the famous pUrvAMnAya-tantra mAlinIvijaya -- the uttarabhAga of which was the focus of abhinavagupta's development of the system. Notably, he opens his ma~NgalAcharaNa of the commentary on the mAlinIvijaya with the phrase vimala-kalAshraya: the vimala-kala is the supreme kala of the system, standing over the 16 basic kala-s, and identified with the great goddess mAlinI (it is also a play on the name of abhinava's biological mother vimalA). Hence, we see this combination as an early attestation of that goddess.
